8/8 Choosing to hide behind the discoveries of others, reciting exhausted proofs and rehearsed theories, adds nothing to future generations. To not embark on your own adventure is to preserve cowardice and incompetence. We don't need nerds. We need builders. Feb 14, 2021 
7/8 The practices rejoiced by academics and the cogs of industry were not found by those reciting textbooks. They were discovered by craftsmen. It is the incapable who flock to ivory towers to recite dead fundamentals and speak of men greater than them. Feb 14, 2021 
6/8 The fields of math and programming are chock full of nerds who can't build, can't express themselves, and pass on their social disabilities to students who graduate as impotent as their professors. Feb 14, 2021 
5/8 Programming is not there to force "best practices" or sterile patterns. It's there for expression, to create, to build. There is no *way* to produce something that connects with people. If your beautiful code makes ugly software, you wrote ugly code. Feb 14, 2021 
4/8 Real-world math never has one answer, and there is no *way* to produce the answer. The practitioner chooses their next steps among countless possibilities, and decides what "done" looks like. It is almost entirely idiosyncratic, instinctive. Feb 14, 2021 
3/8 Language is about expression. If you aren't *creating* something then you aren't speaking the language. People don't communicate through thoughtless adherence to rules. People connect by making subjective choices and personal narratives. Feb 14, 2021 
2/8 Languages only use rules insomuch as they liberate the speaker to bring about something new. The mindless symbol-shuffling promulgated by today's teachers is as impaired as their ability to create. Feb 14, 2021 
1/8 Nothing compares to math and programming when it comes to backwards teaching. Nobody comes out of schooling thinking either of these is a particularly creative discipline. Yet real-world math and programming only look like their scholastic counterparts on the surface. Feb 14, 2021 
Doers improve stuff that needs to be made better. Nerds improve stuff that don't need to be made better. Feb 13, 2021

@ole_b_peters @alex_adamou 7/7 Only through non-ergodicity can we understand how nature rationalizes decision making to favor survival. Feb 12, 2021 
@ole_b_peters @alex_adamou 6/7 Thus decisions made at the local level often benefit the higher scales (dictated by the environment). What looks like bad decision making through the lens of a simplistic (ergodic) frame becomes rational when viewed through the lens of non-ergodicity. Feb 12, 2021 
@ole_b_peters @alex_adamou 5/7 These points of criticality create a dependence structure via intermediate correlations that break symmetry, providing a channel from the environment to the system (nature acts on asymmetries). This means the environment imprints the information used for survival. Feb 12, 2021 
@ole_b_peters @alex_adamou 4/7 In other words, opacity in complex systems arises out of non-ergodicity/extreme path dependence, which ultimately arises out of “mid-point” correlations that exist between pure independence and complete cohesion. Feb 12, 2021 
@ole_b_peters @alex_adamou 3/7 A more complete generalization would be achieved through an information-theoretic description of non-ergodic processes (via computation). Non-ergodicity degrades fidelity between source and destination across an information channel. Feb 12, 2021 
@ole_b_peters @alex_adamou 2/7 Non-ergodic systems introduce path dependence, demanding brute force calculation to get exact solutions. For any appreciable-sized problem this leads to P ≠ NP, thus the intractability of problems across various complexity classes can be framed in terms of non-ergodicity. Feb 12, 2021 
@ole_b_peters @alex_adamou 1/7 Also worth describing this from the computational standpoint. This is P vs NP. Truly ergodic systems are tractable because their outputs are linear sums of their parts. There is no need to visit every path (brute force calculation) to predict the outcome. Feb 12, 2021

11/11 It won’t matter if many of your interests don’t work out, because your attempts to build them will have fed your single true reason for creating. Grow your efforts as a redundancy cascade. You’ll do far more with less, and remain fulfilled despite pieces that collapse. Feb 07, 2021 
10/11 So think deeply about the thing that drives you even when nobody is there to notice. Then fill the expanse of your myriad interests by making them versions of that one thing. Hit multiple birds with a single stone. Feb 07, 2021 
9/11 In other words, your true purpose is the thing you would work on if you were stranded on a deserted island (assume access to electricity and supplies). It’s the thing that doesn’t have to work for you to still be happy. Feb 07, 2021

7/11 Don’t “manage a company”, instead choose talent that delivers the inputs needed to support the well-defined needs of your product/service. Feb 07, 2021 
6/11 When viewed in this fashion the amount of work to accomplish these tasks is dramatically reduced. Don’t “create a course”, instead find ways to capture and showcase the process of you building. Feb 07, 2021 
5/11 To build a company *is* to build a product, and to build a product *is* to teach people how to build. These are 3 different manifestations of the same underlying passion. Critically, they feed off each other, growing through mutual benefit. Feb 07, 2021 
4/11 If you treat your many efforts (e.g. company, product, course) as separate concerns you’ll fail to find the time and resources to complete them. But if you realize they can be 3 versions of the same thing you will hit 3 birds with 1 stone. Feb 07, 2021 
3/11 Rather than pathologizing your many interests you should learn to embrace them by understanding how to do more with less. Feb 07, 2021 
2/11 There are many things you want to accomplish. Maybe start a business, build a product, teach a course, etc. Finite time and resources seem to demand you focus on very few interests. But limiting yourself to few interests is unnatural and unsustainable. Feb 07, 2021 
The Redundancy Cascade 1/11 To be effective at anything you need to find the overlaps between your many interests. This ensures you are working on what you’re meant to do, and that you can scale your efforts, with higher ROI. Let me explain. Feb 07, 2021 
@iprathamesh The more structure used the more you move away from the natural heuristics your mind implements to solve genuinely difficult problems. Thus, less structure leads to increased performance. But, if you remove structure altogether there is no anchor for your heuristics. Feb 07, 2021 
If you aren’t at least partially surprised by someone’s advice then it isn’t worth listening to. Feb 07, 2021 
A lot of people whip things together, delegate work, and brag about their "efficiency." Fast forward a few years and they're just as unskilled as when you first met them. ROI doesn't map solely to your current task. Quality time is skill that gets reinvested again and again. Feb 06, 2021

@FelixHartkorn 2/2 The strength of any idea is how easily it can be destroyed. A testable idea that is still around generations later had (randomly) correct information. The critical point is we cannot know as individuals what makes a “good” idea, we can only ensure ideas can be dismantled. Jan 26, 2021 
@FelixHartkorn 1/2 Whatever survives (progress) cannot be understood or implemented at the individual scale. The information necessary to know what will survive is not available to the individual in their lifetime. The environment must imprint this information over time. Jan 26, 2021 
Ideas that survive don’t come from individuals, they are derived from endless minute contributions. They precipitate out over time. Telling people to invest in their ideas is a failure to understand scale. Individual ideas are for destroying not preserving. Jan 26, 2021

@engexplain @nntaleb 10/10 If “evidence-based” science was genuinely invested in authentic measurement it would leverage *general* measures of dependence; that demands an approach rooted in information-theory. Without entropy you’re just picking data, choosing a narrative, and calling it “evidence.” Jan 13, 2021 
@engexplain @nntaleb 9/10 MI determines how different joint entropy is from marginal entropies. If there is a genuine dependence between variables we would expect information gathered from all variables at once (joint) to be less than the sum of information from independent variables (marginals). Jan 13, 2021 
@engexplain @nntaleb 8/10 Consider Mutual Information (MI), which quantifies the amount of information obtained about one random variable through observing another random variable. This observing of the relationship between variables is what measurement and evidence is all about. Jan 13, 2021 
@engexplain @nntaleb 7/10 We wouldn’t look to conveniently simplistic methods to denote something as evidential, rather we would look for a measure capable of assessing the expected amount of information held in a random variable; there is nothing more fundamental than information. Jan 13, 2021 
@engexplain @nntaleb 6/10 If you were genuinely interested in giving the term “evidence” an authentic and reliable meaning then the methods used to underpin an assertion would be rigorous. Jan 13, 2021 
@engexplain @nntaleb 5/10 Information-theoretic (entropy based) approaches on the other hand can assess *general* measures of dependence. Rather than some specialized (linear) view based on concurrent variation, entropy encompasses the amount of information contained in and between variables. Jan 13, 2021 
@engexplain @nntaleb 4/10 Take Pearson’s correlation, based on covariance. Variation can increase simultaneously across 2 variables for countless reasons, most of which are spurious. Yet this simple notion of “causality” undergirds much of scientific literature. Jan 13, 2021 
@engexplain @nntaleb 3/10 At the heart of the problem is the over-reliance on simplistic statistical techniques that do little more than quantify 2 things moving together. Jan 13, 2021 
@engexplain @nntaleb 2/10 The reality is you can find “evidence” for almost any narrative. Limit the sample size, cherry-pick studies, etc. Systematic reviews, meta analyses, and randomized controlled trials are all susceptible to selective interpretation/narrative fallacy. Jan 13, 2021 
@engexplain @nntaleb 1/10 Science is assumed to be “evidence-based” but that term alone doesn’t mean much. What constitutes good evidence? How is evidence being used? Is it supporting or refuting a hypothesis? Was the hypothesis and experimental design predetermined or found ex post facto? Jan 13, 2021 
People don’t fight their enemies, they fight an imaginary characterization of their enemies. Jan 13, 2021 
Hypotheses can also be revealed randomly (how science is actually done); the fallacy here being one often paints the narrative that the revealed hypothesis was one they started with and tried to refute. Jan 12, 2021 
Popper wanted people to *start* with the hypothesis, but ONLY if the goal was to actively refute it. Finding evidence to support a pre-existing hypothesis (always possible) isn’t science. Survivability only works in one direction. https://t.co/keTf0Tma8w Jan 12, 2021 
Guy messes around until thing works. Academia invents theory (narrative) about why thing works. History tells people if it wasn't for theory thing wouldn't exist. Institutions use history's misattribution to attract young minds. A generation incapable of building things. Jan 12, 2021

@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 11/ So why do engineers sometimes view redundancy as increasing rather then decreasing complexity? Because they believe they need to *manage* the redundancy using more rules. This comes from an incorrect understanding of redundancy. But that’s a whole other conversation. Nov 28, 2020 
@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 10/ Since we cannot access enough information to tell us what all contingencies are (epistemic uncertainty) the smart approach is to simplify the governing rules via redundancy. Nov 28, 2020 
@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 9/ A “lean” bridge, single eye/ear or perfectly matched electrical capacity with the same level of robustness as a redundant system would have to be over-engineered to account for contingencies. Nov 28, 2020 
@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 8/ If we add more struts than necessary to the bridge we don’t need to account for every possible mode of failure. If we have 2 eyes, 2 ears, extra electrical capacity, etc. the rules governing stable vision, hearing, power supply are simpler, less error prone. Nov 28, 2020 
@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 7/ Our willingness to use already-obtained data (a redundancy) massively simplifies the rules we write in our system. Redundancy means reduced complexity, lower probability of error, and a more robust system. Nov 28, 2020 
@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 6/ Or, we could simply stick to our schedule and take whatever data *are* available at those times. This means some data will be new and some old (we already have it from the last scheduled time). Nov 28, 2020 
@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 5/ We could try to conceive of every contingency, guessing every edge case of how/why the data might hang, and account for that in our code. Ping the source, tell other sources to wait, synchronize jobs with a central source etc. Nov 28, 2020 
@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 4/ But if any source “hangs” then arrival will be highly variable/uncertain. Nov 28, 2020 
@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 3/ Imagine writing software that ingests data on a schedule (e.g. once a week) from different sources, each source’s data needed in a certain order. If all goes according to plan each source emits its data and is received on schedule. Nov 28, 2020 
@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 2/ The fundamental reason redundancy is beneficial is it leads to simpler governing rules in the system. Nov 28, 2020 
@BridgeToOverman @paulportesi 1/ Redundancy is normally considered good in terms of fail-safes (extra cabling/struts in bridges, pairs of eyes/ears, excess capacity in power lines) and bad in the sense of increased complexity (more prone to errors). But these are superficial notions of redundancy. Nov 28, 2020

Things don't "follow a distribution" they are forced into a distribution. Nov 27, 2020 
Redundancy is how nature operates on simpler rules. If you try to account for every contingency you end up with over-engineered solutions that break. Successful systems are *not* lean, they are redundant. Few engineers (and scientists) get this. Nov 27, 2020

4/ Even if you tried arguing that your model showed Biden winning *slightly* 90% of the time in a close election, this can only mean one thing: that your model had a highly improbable (and random) run of wins for one candidate. There is no model strength here, only luck. Nov 09, 2020 
3/ The only way one could arrive at a 90% probability of winning in a binary outcome with massive uncertainty is by using garbage inputs, which to be clear, ALWAYS means a garbage model. A lucky pick is still a useless model. Nov 09, 2020 
2/ That’s not how stats/prob or science works. If it were, anyone could make a random prediction, with any odds of winning, and whoever turns out “right” could invent the post-hoc narrative that they knew what they were doing all along (no different than a lottery winner). Nov 09, 2020

@ErikByronTaylor A vector is just a list of numbers, represented as a point in “vector space.” We can either take a row as that list (feature vector) or a column.

@spartanowner1 5/5 Clean animal products and clean vegetables. That’s my focus. Oct 24, 2020 
@spartanowner1 4/5 The right decision is to avoid modern additives when possible, eat what has been touched the least, have periods where you ingest very little, and do what your ancestors did. Anything else is just “evidence” used to push a narrative. Oct 24, 2020 
@spartanowner1 3/5 My animation was about the extra processing needed to mimic the flavor and texture of animal products. This introduces a host of additives never tested through time. There is nothing in the statistical/scientific arsenal that can show these to be safe. Oct 24, 2020 
@spartanowner1 2/5 Humans have adapted to scarcity, variable access, and largely unprocessed foods. So intermittent intake, reasonable variety and untouched foods are the right decision. Oct 24, 2020 
@spartanowner1 1/5 We should use the information we *do* have access to, to make decisions under high uncertainty (e.g. anything nutrition). This information can only come from time, not lab experiments and their p-hacking. Oct 24, 2020

You don’t have to always move quickly, but it should be your default. The attempt to move quickly is what forces nature to reveal her constraints. There is no other way to access this information. Contemplating the shallow isn’t noble, it’s stagnant. Oct 23, 2020

Plans are juvenile attempts at mimicking what emerged from chaos. People convince themselves they’ve observed a workable pattern, and revel in their future success, right up until nature exposes the plan’s naïveté. What planning brings us in comfort it robs us in agility. Oct 11, 2020

2/ Large teams can only scale already-discovered labour. To discover effectively, assume *you* alone will build, and only backfill talent that justifies the cost of communication. Keep teams as small as reasonably possible by not inviting complexity you can’t kill. Sep 27, 2020 
1/ Large teams never produce results comparable to the individual craftsman. The communication overhead degrades the work from lack of cohesive understanding. Teams can explore more possibility space but this doesn’t scale past a few individuals because results are not additive. Sep 27, 2020

@MatthewEGunter @Peter_Turchin @katoi 7/7 Yesterday wasn’t so much subjective, rather it was at the beginning of a scientific enterprise whose reductive approach served the times well. Today, such simplistic narratives fail to meet the goals of science. Narrative is a defining trait of our present day. Sep 07, 2020 
@MatthewEGunter @Peter_Turchin @katoi 6/7 Narratives have artificially preserved a slew of weak models, compounded the replication crisis and made today’s scientific enterprise in dire need of a revolution that accepts the opacity inherent in complex systems. Sep 07, 2020 
@MatthewEGunter @Peter_Turchin @katoi 5/7 This makes today’s age much more about narrative than yesterday’s. The reductive approach to explanation has degraded severely. Occam’s Razor has become misinterpreted as merely “simple is better” rather than “simple is better because it’s more testable.” Sep 07, 2020 
@MatthewEGunter @Peter_Turchin @katoi 4/7 Today, most descriptions or reasons we give of phenomena are attempts at treating complex situations as though they were simple. Humans only understand linear narratives and will gravitate towards simple descriptions rather than accept how opaque phenomena truly are. Sep 07, 2020 
@MatthewEGunter @Peter_Turchin @katoi 3/7 But the need to contextualize “facts” increases the more multiplicative the scenario. This is the problem of induction exacerbated under complexity. Today we’re sitting on top of countless, interacting technologies with a need to describe phenomena at a nontrivial level. Sep 07, 2020 
@MatthewEGunter @Peter_Turchin @katoi 2/7 The Age of Reason was able to be “reasonable” given the prominence of physics and mechanistic engineering. When you’re dealing with particles and parts, induction works well enough, things are fairly predictable, and what I call the “proxy distance” is fairly low. Sep 07, 2020 
@MatthewEGunter @Peter_Turchin @katoi 1/7 Great question. Narrative is stronger now than before since much of what was dealt with in the past was either simple or complicated (not complex). Sep 07, 2020

@UntergrundmannG Nature already does this. Knowing it’s junk isn’t required. As long as it’s testable and still here, it’s good until replaced. Anyway, perhaps over wine sometime 🍷 Cheers. Aug 25, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG Note my tweet about testability and academia. This only works when models are made replaceable, not when they are artificially preserved for ulterior motives. Aug 25, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG No purpose. Nothing teleological. The point is everything must be replaceable. The strength of any model is its replaceability, not its *apparent* description of reality. Aug 25, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG But not understanding is what’s to be expected. The decision to not intervene is based off the system’s uncertainty. Naive intervention is to assume you DO know when you do not. Are you saying attempting to refute is a type of naive intervention? Aug 25, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG I agree this can be important to the individual, but now we're getting into the subjective. Who decides what's important? Aug 25, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG But this is the same answer to every question. It's always "because it survived." Chesterton's Fence (CF) promotes discovering some underlying reason before making a decision, but this is pointless if it's always the same answer. CF would halt most real-world decision making. Aug 25, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG In other words, that which replaces the incumbent is stumbled upon. Of course this isn't the narrative told to students in textbooks. But we can't create the way we consume. Aug 25, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG You don't require a story of how the incumbent model works. These are just narratives, which may or may not be some fundamental truth about reality. The environment dictates what lives and dies (when done properly). Many (most/all?) models throughout history were serendipitous. Aug 25, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG There is no requirement to understand the why. It's what survived that works. You might find a reason, but the reason isn't required. This is really the point of Popperism. Knowledge is gained by providing a better model, not by studying the incumbent model's deficiencies. Aug 25, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG There's no need for replacement, but there is the need to attempt to replace. That's the true purpose of evidence. If we remove the attempt then the word "survive" is meaningless. Aug 25, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG Chesterton’s Fence suggests one must figure out *why* something exists prior to destroying it. What I am saying is more Popperian; you propose something *demonstrably* better. This doesn't require a *why*, since the only answer is *because it survived.* Aug 25, 2020

When schools fail in their responsibility they pass on their incompetence to the students. Rather than owning their inability to teach they get away with framing students as inherently deficient. Lack of understanding relates to the presentation, not the person. Aug 04, 2020

People stress over what they invest time in. Their focus. But in complex problem solving there is no requirement for smaller tasks to be aware of the larger objective. In fact, "misaligned" tasks contribute a great deal to the global target. Have goals. But get distracted. Aug 03, 2020 
The momentary disregard for one's lived experience can bring great benefit to the individual. Stepping outside the problem to view it objectively can bring insight into dynamics that affect lives. Complex problems often manifest as paradox. There is *both* pattern and people. Aug 02, 2020

Note that there is an asymmetry in the testability. Simpler models are to be preferred upfront because a more complex model will be harder to test (get rid of). BUT this only works when researchers have the constitution to destroy what they create. Not what we see in Academia https://t.co/JQkp5bxcPD Jul 29, 2020 
@kmlyounes You wouldn't want to favor complexity arbitrarily, anymore than you would want to favor simplicity arbitrarily. Both equally unjustified (and damaging). The filtering of too-simple and too-complex is built into the concept of survivability. Jul 29, 2020 
@kmlyounes It still works but only when used properly. Focusing on simplicity means almost all simple models will be killed/ stripped of their overly-simplistic attributes. What is left is a model with the needed complexity to approximate phenomena (but no more). https://t.co/qcSVz1AAht Jul 29, 2020 
2/2 Stripping simple theories of their superfluous attributes is baked-in via survivability. It's easier to find a good model automatically then by keeping a lifeless model alive for academic reasons. Much of today's "science" is staffed by tenured caretakers of the undead. Jul 29, 2020 
1/2 Taking Occam's razor at face value won't tell you *how* to avoid multiplying an entity without necessity. The perversion of this heuristic is almost guaranteed without the capacity to be contradicted by evidence. Jul 29, 2020 
Simple theories are only preferred because they're easy to kill, not because they're "elegant." If you're artificially preserving your graceful model for simplicity's sake (career-boosting, storytelling...most of Academia) you're actively working against science. Jul 29, 2020

A heuristic for knowing you understand something is when you realize it's far simpler than your initial impression. Never assume an equation, concept, theory or opinion is irreducibly difficult. It never is. You're looking at an elaborate expression made by a human. Jul 28, 2020

@ihirschfield15 Discoveries and knowledge existing within a culture prior to the imposition of objectivity. Objectivity must strip subjective experience from its consideration. If objectivity becomes *the* path towards truth it must discard truths held outside its sphere (e.g. cultural ones). Jul 28, 2020 
Don’t build self-doubt around that which you don’t understand. Every misunderstood concept is a nucleus, in which later understandings crystalize. There is no correct grasp of the topic, no dictated awareness to which you must conform. Your knowledge precipitates through time. Jul 27, 2020 
Advice is often the byproduct of its opposite. Only after years of naive ambition does one come to suggest those younger than he should avoid such artless longing. A well-ordered life exists by virtue of many unordered things. Jul 27, 2020 
It is not objectivity that deserves blame for modern inequities but rather the imposition of objectivity at the expense of existing cultural revelation and values. Jul 27, 2020 
@JamesMarsh79 7/7 If we make decisions on what *is* known (explosive growth process) rather than what cannot be known now (which specific steps are good/bad) then it’s not a contradiction. But that may not be what confused you. Jul 27, 2020 
@JamesMarsh79 6/7 I can take a number of imperfect steps (homemade masks, hand washing, social distancing, etc.) which reduce (not eliminate) the chances of potential exposure, while still making small allowances to live my life (visit grandma, stay hydrated). Jul 27, 2020 
@JamesMarsh79 5/7 But based on the properties of a pandemic (multiplicative growth) we know that a lifestyle of caution, balanced with the need to continue living, is the right decision. We still take risks, but we take precautionary measures, on average, to limit worst case scenarios. Jul 27, 2020 
@JamesMarsh79 4/7 If I take my mask off for a few seconds to drink water on a plane, is this good or bad? Using evidence cannot currently answer this question. We don’t know enough from studies about viral load, exposure timing, etc. Jul 27, 2020 
@JamesMarsh79 3/7 It’s the difference between basing decisions on evidence and basing decisions on an understanding of the properties of a system. Jul 27, 2020 
@JamesMarsh79 2/7 #1 is problematic under complexity for reasons of epistemic uncertainty. But #2 maps to something known about a process. Jul 27, 2020 
@JamesMarsh79 1/7 I think an important distinction in the use of data/evidence is: 1. using evidence in the attempt to strengthen an inductive argument/prediction; 2. using evidence as a hint to the type of phenomenon we’re dealing with. Jul 27, 2020

@davidboxenhorn @nntaleb @sapinker 5/n (end) You can do the destructive half of the reverse engineering (pick it apart) but you’ll never do the constructive part (piece it back together) *explicitly*. This is known from both math and computation. Jul 20, 2020 
@davidboxenhorn @nntaleb @sapinker 4/n This is why reverse-engineering / reductionist approaches fail under complexity. You can inspect the properties of the components all you want, but you’ll NEVER learn the explicit path from component interactions to emergent observation. Jul 20, 2020 
@davidboxenhorn @nntaleb @sapinker 3/n If you want starling murmurations to occur in every generation this does not require a linear mechanism to occur at *both* component and emergent level. It only requires linearity be preserved at the component level. Jul 20, 2020 
@davidboxenhorn @nntaleb @sapinker 2/n The point is you’ll never be able to *reconstruct* / know the PATH that led from components to emergence. Jul 20, 2020 
@davidboxenhorn @nntaleb @sapinker 1/n The linearity is being preserved at the component-level, not the emergent level. Obviously for heritability to work the components must work linearly through multiple generations such that traits are preserved through time. Jul 20, 2020

I'm not against local talent performing their original compositions, or even the classics. But the industry that brings movies and music to the masses does nothing for the craft of film or music. Jul 15, 2020

@Ugo_UF Thus uncertainty is where the information lives. If you want to access the information you need an approach that operates effectively inside uncertainty (can tease out the info). Lindy is such an approach. Whatever survives contains the information about survival. Jul 13, 2020 
@Ugo_UF Information is what *quantifies* uncertainty. It is directly related to entropy. If I flip a coin I get less information than if I roll a die. The die has more possible outcomes thus more “surprisal” when we learn the outcome. more surprise = more information Jul 13, 2020

@ektrit @nntaleb 10/n In short, you *should* trust Lindy outright, but under the condition you do not accept Lindy things by their name alone. You have to understand the universal enduring properties of the thing, not its labels or present day interpretations. Jul 12, 2020 
@ektrit @nntaleb 9/n But it doesn’t mean blindly accepting the label we attach to what survives. It means the rich conversation to have is around the deeper, informational aspects of what lasts. Jul 12, 2020 
@ektrit @nntaleb 8/n Lindy provides the decision mechanism under uncertainty because the information needed has been imprinted directly from nature, through time. People cannot access this kind of information in their lifetime, let alone via contrived experiments. Jul 12, 2020 
@ektrit @nntaleb 7/n Thus when looking at Lindy the question is what underlying universal aspects of a particular thing have staying power. It is not some labelled set of values interpreted at an arbitrary level of abstraction. Jul 12, 2020 
@ektrit @nntaleb 6/n It isn’t “religion” that survives, it is some set of informational, underlying properties of religions that endure despite the vagaries of economic, social, industrial and cultural life. Jul 12, 2020 
@ektrit @nntaleb 5/n Looking at religion, it is a system of designated behaviors and practices. This is not some monolithic concept/approach. It advances through time with great variation, reinterpretations, and shifting attitudes. Jul 12, 2020 
@ektrit @nntaleb 4/n But the discussion around Lindy doesn’t stop at accepting that which has survived. Jul 12, 2020 
@ektrit @nntaleb 3/n What Lindy provides is a mechanism whereby we can make the decision despite the uncertainty. The obvious rebuttal is that providing a decision mechanism does not guarantee something is good or bad. What if relying on Lindy constrains modern attitudes to outdated values? Jul 12, 2020 
@ektrit @nntaleb 2/n It assumes the information necessary to make such a decision is accessible, and can be agreed-upon, without investing in Lindy itself. Jul 12, 2020 
@ektrit @nntaleb 1/n What this gets wrong is it frames Lindy as just another option from which to cherry pick values, and assumes society is capable of deciding what is right/wrong *despite* the massive epistemic uncertainty. https://t.co/L43lApUlV0 Jul 12, 2020

Those who dismiss rational debate have something in common with those who embrace "facts" without question. They are both ignorant about limitations. An appreciation for the power of logic must coincide with a deep recognition of its deficiencies. https://t.co/UiHu5OVVgE Jul 08, 2020 
@HietanenPaavo Of course you could also use Azle's *download_file* function in your browser's console 😉 https://t.co/GNBNMtrRmJ Jul 08, 2020 
@HietanenPaavo Yes. I created Azle to enable (very) rapid prototyping of the front-end of an application. It's high-fidelity as you can do almost anything, but uses an easy syntax with little overhead. I added the download button. #javascript #programming https://t.co/upGLWJcTHO Jul 08, 2020 
@HietanenPaavo Glad you’re enjoying the project and the Azle library. You can paste the CDN url into a browser and save your own local copy. I can also add a download button to Azle’s homepage. Jul 08, 2020 
Water doesn’t go bad. 💦 Water bottles may or may not leach chemicals into the water. If they do, it takes a very long time, with little evidence they’re unhealthy. Do the expiration dates on water bottles (1-2 years) make sense? Yes. If you get why you get wearing masks. Jul 08, 2020 
History repeats itself when a piece of the human condition is regarded as belonging to a single group of people. Jul 08, 2020 
The mathematicians who *can* explain things intuitively (very few) are *very* good at understanding. Math's abstraction makes you work harder for it. The point is, concepts are the filter, not the math. Never let someone shuffle symbols absent intuition. They are imposters. https://t.co/V55qYEWrc9 Jul 07, 2020 
The more complex the domain the bigger the requirement to publish negative results. A model's strength becomes (much!) more suspect under complexity, demanding affirmation of its survivability. The degradation of #science rests squarely on the idea of using evidence as support. Jul 07, 2020 
You can shuffle equations at the professor-level while understanding little. Math gives a free pass on “education” to cog-style “thinkers” as there is little obligation to intuition. It’s the asymmetry most people miss. Everyone talks concepts. Few talk esoteric symbols. Jul 07, 2020 
And in some cases far worse than useless. Highly damaging. Jul 07, 2020 
The problem with much of science isn’t lack of prediction. It’s the thin slice of reality scientists predict into. When you frame the world under a constrained view, prediction in any domain is both easy and useless. Jul 07, 2020 
How do you tell a complete lie using nothing but facts? Why does collecting evidence *not* make models/theories stronger? How does evidence make bad models live too long? When do facts no longer support your argument? https://t.co/f28QPsPYZO Jul 07, 2020

“But the teachers I learn from have real world experience.” This makes no difference. Why? Because you cannot create the way you consume. Expertise is not conserved under narrative. Proficiency can only be forged by what is revealed through your own creativity. Jul 06, 2020 
If you get told the structure you cannot understand why a particular structure works. If you build without knowing the structure, you understand deeply why a particular structure works. Stop looking for someone to show you how. Nature has that covered. You just have to build. Jul 06, 2020 
@nntaleb Ok now this joke isn’t even a stretch: https://t.co/8jNPM7xaH5 Jul 06, 2020 
You can’t pay for an adventure. Jul 06, 2020 
Older people have more potential. Your diverse experiences are what position you to map your varied self onto things the world might need. Just as a spring stores energy as stretched, it is experience that adds future possibilities. more life = more potential Jul 05, 2020 
Rich insights, profound connections, and universal truths are culled from nature by creating. It’s the patterns that pop out via the steadfast attempt to bring about the new.

@jgordonfisher I just started a podcast called NonTrivial that looks to unpack these kinds of questions. If you haven’t already, check it out. But in short, embracing uncertainty and complexity rather than trying to structure your approach to creativity and life. Jul 05, 2020 
@Eminemead No problem. And thanks for the feedback 👍 Jul 05, 2020 
Notice how great food tastes when you’re hungry? Delight is something you already have. It lies dormant inside you. You experience it by removing things from your life. The lie of modernity is that you get happy by addition. You don’t work towards happiness, you uncover it. Jul 04, 2020 
It takes a confluence of experiences to achieve great things. The moment before the inflection point is the moment of greatest despair. So many pieces, little evidence of success. But it isn’t about evidence. It’s knowing eventually one more piece will connect it all together. Jul 04, 2020 
Collaboration inside companies is largely a myth. 90% (at least) of employees are there for the pay/status, not out of passion for the work. No passion = poor/no contribution. Very few contributors = bad/inflexible problem solving. Collectives in *nature* work for a reason. Jul 04, 2020

@johndawkins Then perhaps there be seeds of change. Jul 03, 2020 
Academics seem less adept at understanding logic than practitioners. Seems counterintuitive, until you realize... An academic’s career/identity is dependent on maintaining narrative, whereas the practitioner benefits from modifying/switching narratives in order to survive. Jul 03, 2020 
@johndawkins There is a *way* to do things. That fundamentals must precede discovery. Jul 03, 2020 
Choose your battles, but say no to almost all of them. Jul 03, 2020 
Those interested in sounding smart never bring things into the world. When something sounds smart it's regurgitated; a polished version of someone else's discovery. Builders operate in the unknown, the unaccepted. Their work only sounds smart to the next generation. Jul 03, 2020 
Don’t give other people work. Say what *you* are going to contribute to bring something into reality. If others are interested they’ll contribute their piece. If you don’t have time to contribute, don’t bring it up. Delegation is not a skill. Jul 03, 2020 
There’s no such thing as taking the academic approach to creativity, there’s only *telling* people you took the academic approach, after the fact. Actually taking the academic approach can produce only one outcome; increasing the risk around something that already exists. Jul 03, 2020

@famadeo @LorenzoWVilla We are not disagreeing on this. Jul 02, 2020 
@famadeo @LorenzoWVilla I’ll put it this way. When you lose via compression there is something left over. The piece that nature held onto. How are you understanding the piece that nature held onto? Jul 02, 2020 
@famadeo @LorenzoWVilla Or more precisely, why are you equating the compression in math to the compression in analogy, if that’s what you are doing. Jul 02, 2020 
@famadeo @LorenzoWVilla Why are you suggesting an analogy is a result of compression? Jul 02, 2020 
Observe your emotions before deciding to act on them. Jul 02, 2020

@LorenzoWVilla @famadeo Type correctly and state your argument. One more chance. Jul 02, 2020 
@famadeo @LorenzoWVilla 2/2 Einstein trusted math without intuition until he arrived at something intuitive. Without arriving at the intuition he would have achieved nothing (or at least have convinced nobody). Jul 02, 2020 
@famadeo @LorenzoWVilla 1/2 You would have to give an example of some realization that cannot be made into an analogy. Math can take you on a journey absent analogy (shuffling equations) but it must eventually land on analogy if you want to interpret it. Jul 02, 2020 
This is what gets you blocked. Lazy non-arguments. If you can’t back up your emotional BS don’t waste people’s time. https://t.co/zc9rZ8Jn60 Jul 02, 2020 
@financequant @LorenzoWVilla No you didn’t. You made a single statement without supporting it in any fashion. Go buy a book on logic. Nobody should have to waste time parsing your isolated assertion, attempting to stucture it into an argument on your behalf. Jul 02, 2020 
@financequant @LorenzoWVilla I am asking you to elaborate. It means to develop or present your statement in more detail. Please make your argument. Jul 02, 2020 
@financequant @LorenzoWVilla The verb, not the adjective. Jul 02, 2020 
@spartanowner1 Haven’t read it but sounds inline with my philosophy. A strong sign of maturity/wisdom around delivering fulfilling work is overcoming the anxiety regarding the task. It’s learning to engage your work seamlessly, *not* engineering “quality time”, and allowing nature to reveal. Jul 02, 2020 
Try to get it done everytime you touch it. Doesn’t matter the project. Doesn’t matter how unrealistic that is. If you don’t feel alive trying to knock off a project and get it out the door what’s the point. Don’t relax into work. Brevity is the filter. Jul 02, 2020

7/7 This is how progress is any field, and society at large, occurs. It is not through the accumulation of accepted practice. It is via its capacity to be challenged. Jul 01, 2020 
6/7 Rigor is not in your symbols, your language, or your field’s authorities. Rigor is your set of questions posed against accepted norms. Jul 01, 2020 
5/7 Rigor cannot be the thing itself. Even if your tooling has the ability to match reality, this does not mean you are matching reality with it. Jul 01, 2020 
4/7 The longer one’s “rigor” remains unchallenged the less likely any reasonable objection will be tolerated. With time, it takes a larger and larger revolution to unseat the incumbent’s reign. Jul 01, 2020 
3/7 It takes very few generations for a field’s authorities and students to accept their dogma as baseline reality. This blinds the expert to the lack of truth and utility in their work. Jul 01, 2020 
2/7 Ignorance breeds an unconscious consent of anything passed down by “experts“, which through time, allows naive ideas to gain unwarranted footholds in and outside academia. Jul 01, 2020 
On the Proper Use of “Rigor” 1/7 The more esoteric, the more unchallenged the presentation. It’s not enough to suggest showcasing so-called “rigor” grounds a work closer to reality. Looking rigorous has the unavoidable consequence of being accepted at face value. Jul 01, 2020 
More than 1 thing can be true at once. 😲 Math can “almost always” act as a haven for those without skill AND be wielded by the skillful AT THE SAME TIME. Spend time thinking about words before getting triggered. https://t.co/C1KiLrXGR4 Jul 01, 2020

If you’re getting angry at someone because they appear, to you, to have conflicting opinions, they’re probably just thinking for themselves. They own their thoughts, rather than subscribing them to a particular group. Maybe ask yourself why varied thought is making you mad. Jun 30, 2020

@LorenzoWVilla No, it’s exceedingly easy to BS with math, since few people will challenge it. Concepts are the filter. If you can’t explain using analogy what your formulae supposedly represent you don’t understand the material. Period. Jun 30, 2020 
Math is almost always a haven for those without practical skill. It’s a place for “spectrum” types to crawl behind, masking their inability to operate under real-world complexity, using society’s ignorance about math as a pretense for looking “smart.” Jun 30, 2020 
In the time it took you to think of what to build someone else made 5 different prototypes of the same idea. Less thinking. More building. Jun 29, 2020

@spartanowner1 Bringing your focused energy onto your tasks with settled ideas is far more productive. Take breaks, walk, think, then apply short bursts of energy to the task. Repeat until it converges to some final apparent solution. Jun 28, 2020 
@spartanowner1 Indeed. Think about how fluid your thoughts and emotions are while walking. They are unrestricted by the task itself. You can move in-and-out of ideas readily, retaining and tossing as needed, until only some clear thought survives. Jun 28, 2020 
@spartanowner1 Anchors are helpful to those with the constitution to destroy them. If you can toss your footholds at will then by all means. But IMO this requires an unnatural reliance on willpower.

If your plan going in turned out to be correct it means you got lucky AND know very little about why it worked.

@nntaleb Remove the friction and you’re left with no reason to create. Jun 26, 2020 
@AynAndCable That’s up to the reader to parse, unfortunately. Jun 25, 2020 
A mentor can only help those who’ve attempted the problem. If you ask a question absent your own attempt the answer is worthless. I know you *feel* like it’s worth something, but rest assured, it’s not. You must learn in context. Only ask about things you’ve built. Jun 25, 2020 
95% of math in journals are old equations used countless times by others. It's technical filler to bulk up the article. It's used to appear sophisticated despite adding nothing, having no original contribution, restating some obvious concept. Never *ever* be intimidated by math. Jun 25, 2020 
Those who run from large negative possibilities survive. Those who run towards large positive possibilities thrive. In scenario 1, paranoid behavior places bounds on negative impact. In scenario 2, engaging the unknown reduces the anxiety that is preventing its possibility. Jun 25, 2020

2/2 Schooling schedules education as a drawn-out process, and pathologizes intermittent effort as “lack of focus.” It’s wholly unnatural, and only “works” on the young and naive. You are equipped to survive. You can learn, fight, explore, and strategize till your last breath. Jun 19, 2020 
1/2 If you take the schooling mentality into the wild you’ll wither. Learning, fighting, exploring, strategizing all work best using explosive bursts of energy. Something that stays with you well into old age. But schooling conditions people to favor stamina instead. Jun 19, 2020

Don’t confuse “going deeper” with reductionism. The component details are only more profound if that which you are studying is pre-emergent. A profound truth may exist only at the surface. To go deep is to understand something universally true, regardless where it resides. Jun 18, 2020 
@trishankkarthik @101010Lund @ptbrodie 2/2 “We still need to use our imagination to define the possibility space of behavior.” True, but appropriate methods do exist to cut down the work in searching this space (i.e. meta-heuristics). Might be worth touching on these (see AutoML) Jun 18, 2020 
@trishankkarthik @101010Lund @ptbrodie 1/2 Interesting piece. I’ll have to look more into FRAM. As for ML “always making assumptions about the underlying dynamics” ....true...but it’s important to contrast how this is done in ML versus statistics. https://t.co/2RbamsgUB8 Jun 18, 2020

@MacurdyTrader Good example. Willpower alone would have made the transition seamless (do yoga at home) if it worked. You need the “studio” at home, but not just the physical area.

@trishankkarthik Definitely interesting stuff. Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik It seems intuitive that the interior of a BH is “undecidable”, and in some sense truly infinite. In fact Chaitin (to the chagrin of mathematicians) interprets his work on Omega as an intimate connection between math and physics. Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik This would also preclude a TOE in physics; something most complexity people agree with (at least they should). Of course this all comes back around to Gödel's incompleteness theorem, whereby we know there are statements that are unknowable/undecidable. Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik This means it cannot be “compressed” into a smaller theory (no TOE). This incompressibility is what seems to connect Chaitin’s Omega to the center of BHs. In other words, it seems reasonable that a BH center is irreducible and infinity complex. Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik Omega is also infinitely complex (no finite program can compute it), and irreducible. It is thus truly, and purely, random (algorithmically). Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik There seems to be an intuitive connection since Omega brings us into the realm where mathematical truth has no structure (can only be understood statistically). This also seems to connect to Wolfram’s use of continuous mathematics to approximate “his” discrete universe. Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik From complexity/volume/entropy we can obviously connect to algorithmic information theory and thus entertain the interesting properties of Chaitin’s Omega. Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik It would also be interesting to see how Wolfram models interaction between particles given his “particles” at this point are abstractions built on graphs with causal edges coming in and out (analogous to a BH abstraction). Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik I imagine Wolfram would look for a return to some initial set of nodes in “branchial space”, assuming his hypergraphs can be modeled as dynamic/evolve through time. Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik The connection to computing rests on complexity, since the complexity of a BH can be considered the number of computations needed to recover its initial quantum state, AND this increases, since particles inside a BH interact (info about initial state gets scrambled). Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik So we know a BH’s area can in some sense be thought of as the information storage capacity of a black hole. And Susskind showed that complexity and volume of BH grow at same rate (fastest rate possible in universe). Jun 05, 2020 
@trishankkarthik The connection seems intuitive. It’s been suggested black holes (BH) grow in volume due to an increase in complexity. Bekenstein showed the area of an event horizon corresponds to its entropy (number of possible micro arrangements of particles inside black hole). Jun 05, 2020 
such* concerns Jun 04, 2020

It is safe to assume that estimates from random multiplicative processes have no relation to true average values. Jun 03, 2020 
What all this shows is how the behavior of moments (e.g average, variance, etc.) in a distribution are crucially sensitive to extreme events. As such, there is no analog to the CLT where typical events are sufficient to determine the statistical properties. Jun 03, 2020 
There is a smooth, sharp increase in the observed average as the number of realizations increases (access the tail). Eventually a crossover point is reached where the value converges to the true average. Jun 03, 2020 
The true average value of any N-fold product of random variables is governed by extreme events that live at the tail of the distribution. But unless a very large sample size is taken, the most probable event will dominate what we see. Jun 03, 2020 
Rather, each moment is governed by *distinct portions of the underlying distribution*. It is important to keep this in mind when extreme events play a major role. Jun 03, 2020 
One *must* use an appropriate expansion procedure that leads to the correct continuum limit. When applying an appropriate method one finds that *a unique scale that accounts for all the moments does not exist*. Jun 03, 2020 
Fundamentally, there is no analog of a CLT for random multiplicative processes because the mean value depends on *correlations among factors* comprising the product. The pitfalls of applying the usual Gaussian approximation for random multiplicative processes are crucial. Jun 03, 2020 
The extreme event will make a finite contribution to the average, and a *dominant* contribution to the higher moments of the product. In some circumstances the values of the moment is determined by a single event. Jun 03, 2020 
As stated earlier, the ratio between the average value of the product and most probable value diverges exponentially as N -> ∞. The discrepancy between the average and most probable event is understood by the important role played by rare events. Jun 03, 2020 
Thus, the most probable event only yields a good approximation for the average value when dealing with the sum in a random additive process. The most probable event is inadequate for determining the average value of the product in a random multiplicative process. Jun 03, 2020 
It is only when one has the resources to sample a finite fraction of *all* the states of the system that the measurement will converge to the *true average* value. Jun 03, 2020 
But in a simulation one can increase the scale of the experiment, allowing one to access progressively more extreme events. A consequence is the observed average increasing. Jun 03, 2020 
In any realistic situation, one can sample only an infinitesimal fraction of the total states of the system. This means one is almost guaranteed to detect only the *typical* value of an observable. Jun 03, 2020 
Knowing that the average is dominated by rare events has fundamental implications for studying systems governed by a random multiplicative process. Jun 03, 2020 
What is needed is an accurate continuum limit for a random multiplicative process for which the correct asymptotic behavior of higher moments can be obtained. Jun 03, 2020 
But in doing this we lose information about the tail of the distribution; a tail whose details are crucial in determining the higher moments of the product. Jun 03, 2020 
It is thus necessary to account properly for the extremes in the distribution in order to compute averages correctly. A time-honored approximation for describing a distribution of products is noting that the logarithm of the product is a sum, and thus obeys a Gaussian. Jun 03, 2020 
The behavior of *products* is considerably richer than that of a sum of random variables. A major feature in the former process relates to extreme events. While exponentially rare, they are also exponentially different than the most probable value. Jun 03, 2020 
It is only when a simulation is large enough to sample a finite fraction of *all* states in a system that a crossover to the true average occurs. Jun 03, 2020 
Random multiplicative processes are ubiquitous, underlying a diverse range of natural phenomena. The ratio between the average value of the product and most probable value diverges exponentially as N -> ∞ Jun 03, 2020 
There is a big difference between the asymptotic behavior of a random *product* and that of a *sum* of random variables. The latter process will have behavior inline with the central limit theorem (CLT). This is not the case for random multiplicative processes. Jun 03, 2020 
On the failure of Gaussians, and how there is no analog to Central Limit Theorem for a random multiplicative process. From S. Redner, published 1989 https://t.co/G09zzbunIy Major points, slightly paraphrased: Jun 03, 2020 
@wzeller42 No, they cannot write better programs, they can learn better programs. Jun 03, 2020 
There’s no such thing as an “explanatory variable.” There are participating variables, and unless you’re studying a system with less than 3 pieces, you will only ever know that they participate. Knowing that a variable plays a role is not the same as knowing what role. Jun 03, 2020

Human child is born, supremely equipped to solve complex problems. Child begins schooling where they are convinced juvenile behaviors are to be learned away. Child becomes adult, has lost ability to operate under complexity. School recommends adult education. May 28, 2020

1/2 We will never create a society that stamps out untruthful information. There is nothing that can be done to guarantee what is reported is reliable. Nature has the built-in ability to weed out erroneous information. It uses massive variation + time to retain what works. May 28, 2020

The only way modern man knows how to “learn” something is by taking it out of its natural habitat. Isolation, reductionism, separatism, categorization. Concepts viewed out of context force man to apply his own contrived idea of understanding onto nature. Be less modern. May 27, 2020

You can find the final code here: https://t.co/8xS6zvu9e3 May 26, 2020 
https://t.co/emTM7j6GyJ May 26, 2020 
I want to add a spinner when the user clicks FORECAST so they know to wait for the result. I also want the Plotly chart to be transparent so we can see that nice blue background we had. Finally, I'm going to change the title of our app now that it's something real. May 26, 2020 
These are the major parts that go into building any application. With these skills you can grow and improve into the world of software development, or just use it as a hobby to build stuff. Before sending the code off to GitHub I want to make some final style changes. May 26, 2020 
We achieved everything on our original list: https://t.co/FSyr3nME5S May 26, 2020 
And that's it! Let's refresh our browser one last time to see the full application in action. https://t.co/M6Ac657ydQ May 26, 2020 
Have a look over the final index.html to see the changes. You should recognize the final changes as familiar code. If anything looks unfamiliar search online to learn why it might have been added. May 26, 2020 
In our index.html file I added 2 new functions for prepping data for the 2nd trace (to show the forecast). You'll see it's very similar to the ones we wrote for trace 1. I also added the new "draw_forecast" function to the "done" property of our call_api function. May 26, 2020 
All this in about 10 lines of code. Not bad! (There's that abstraction working for us again). You can look over the final https://t.co/aSuuW2Q3iM file in the codebase on GitHub, which I link at the end of this thread. May 26, 2020 
Our final https://t.co/aSuuW2Q3iM file receives data from the front-end (which we already know how to do), prepares the data as needed by the Prophet library (as specified in their docs), trains a forecast model, makes a prediction, and returns the results. May 26, 2020 
Prophet is a forecasting library for time series, and has a Quickstart guide for Python that should get us up and running: https://t.co/GiPBlkvpOD May 26, 2020 
Finally, let's build a forecasting model to make predictions based on the user's choice of type (deaths, confirmed, recovered) and horizon. After some searching around I found a library called Prophet, which was open-sourced by Facebook. https://t.co/qoE9Pwrjt3 May 26, 2020 
We now have our events hooked-up: https://t.co/C4s2eKvrxB May 26, 2020 
Here I am grabbing the slider value, and the "x" and "y" data from our existing get_dates_and_cases function. https://t.co/uXZU6iNH5I May 26, 2020 
Our application is officially interacting with our back-end service, passing data to, and receiving a response from, our Python code. Let's replace the "x" and "y" parameters with the actual data we need to send, and also add the forecast horizon from the slider value. May 26, 2020 
Refresh your browser and click on the FORECAST button: https://t.co/SYSfUPALPW May 26, 2020 
We added an event listener to our button, just like we did to our dropdown earlier. We also added Azle's call_api inside the event's function property, specifying the URL to our Flask service, the "x" and "y" parameters, and an alert when data are returned. May 26, 2020 
To send this to our web service we could use JavaScript's fetch API again. Instead, let's use Azle's call_api function, inside our button's event listener: https://t.co/u5ZJbzdMIB May 26, 2020 
We already know how to "grab" the values from UI elements, using Azle's grab_value function. We also have our fetched data structured nicely in our az.hold_value.fetched_data object. May 26, 2020 
Note: We could fetch the covid data in the back-end rather than passing it over-the-wire, but then we would be fetching data twice. Since we are only forecasting a few dates and values it makes more sense to use the data already fetched from the front-end. May 26, 2020 
We need to pass the following data to our back-end: - dropdown choice - slider value - dates and # of cases May 26, 2020 
@Avere_Augere They want to be involved. May 26, 2020 
People don’t want answers, they want a conversation. May 26, 2020 
@mathris Same deal. Playing games (chess, sudoku, Rubik’s cube, etc.) and replicating patterns on sheet music is simplistic, but looks impressive. The kid inventing a new game or composing music deserves notice. Not mere rule-following or memorization, but true creation. May 26, 2020 
Let's hook it all up, end-to-end, so that our front-end application written in JavaScript (Azle) is passing data to, and receiving data from, our web service (rather than the browser). If we succeed, the only thing left to do will be building a good forecasting model in Python. May 26, 2020 
Our web service simply returns the values we passed for "x" and "y". Not too exciting, but it does prove our web service works. May 26, 2020 
This is the standard way to communicate with a REST API when using URLs in the browser. The ? mark precedes the first parameter name, and the & precedes the second. Open a new tab in your browser, add the above URL to the top, and hit enter. You should see the following: https://t.co/KGti5h4PJ6 May 26, 2020 
Our back-end is being served on "localhost", port 5000, with an endpoint called "predict_covid", accepting parameters called "x" and "y". To pass all this information "over the wire" we can construct the following URL: http://localhost:5000/predict_covid/?x=100&y=400 May 26, 2020 
You are now running a web service, exposing your Python code to any application capable of communicating with it. This is pretty cool, considering so many high-powered libraries are available today in Python. Just think what you could create! 🙃 May 26, 2020 
Now, start our web service by running the following: python https://t.co/aSuuW2Q3iM ...and hitting enter. https://t.co/FqdWfRV494 May 26, 2020 
You should see both the index.html and https://t.co/aSuuW2Q3iM files. Hard to believe our entire application is only 2 files. Thanks to the level of abstraction available in today's tools we only require minimal code to create a full blown app. 🙂 May 26, 2020 
With terminal open, change into our my_app directory by running the following: cd Desktop/my_app/ ...and hit enter. Now type: ls ... and hit enter again. https://t.co/bWsfcdOiza May 26, 2020 
I am using a Mac, so everything you see here will be in macOS. But the same general steps apply to PC. Open terminal. Quickest way in Mac is to use Spotlight Search by typing "command + spacebar" and typing in "terminal": https://t.co/o6jRJf3rTA May 26, 2020 
So far we've just been using a browser and notepad to create our application. But now we need to speak directly with our operating system, and for that we must use terminal (command prompt on PC). May 26, 2020 
Let's fire up our web service to see if it works. If it all goes well we'll add our prediction model and start serving real forecasts for our application to consume and visualize. May 26, 2020 
Finally, we specify the "port" at the end of the file. A port is a programmatic docking point that grants access from the outside world to our local system. I chose port 5000. You can choose a different number if you want (if it's already being used your computer will tell you) May 26, 2020 
Beneath the "route" in our https://t.co/aSuuW2Q3iM file we create a function. Python functions look different than Javascript functions, but the idea is the same; a modular piece of code that can accept arguments and return a value. I called our function forecaster. May 26, 2020 
Much of today's back-end machinery in enterprise software is made available as services, consumed as REST APIs. This makes it easier to patch together various functionality and maintain and scale the application. May 26, 2020 
We also set a "route" which is an "endpoint" for our service. Recall our discussion on endpoints when we looked at fetching covid-19 data from a REST API. If you're thinking we are making our own REST API right now then you are correct :) May 26, 2020 
Whereas in JavaScript we used "CDNs" to add extra libraries to our application, in Python we use import statements. Above we are importing Flask, as well as the "request" and "jsonify" libraries, which will enable us to receive and send data from-and-to our front-end. May 26, 2020 
We will need a few more pieces, like extra libraries, to get our web service suitable for our purpose. Here is what our https://t.co/aSuuW2Q3iM file will look like: https://t.co/wNnD0Vdl5i May 26, 2020 
Now we will add some basic Flask code to our currently blank https://t.co/aSuuW2Q3iM file. Flask's documentation has a Quickstart guide where they show us the minimal code needed to set things up: https://t.co/JL0McCp2kb May 26, 2020 
We will use a lightweight web framework called Flask to build our web service in Python. Let's do that now. At the beginning we created a my_app folder, currently holding our index.html file. Let's add another file to this folder called https://t.co/aSuuW2Q3iM : https://t.co/5hr4qEr6eo May 26, 2020 
Getting a front-end communicating with a back-end requires a web service. A web service will allow us to send requests to the server and receive something in return. This is what we need, since we want to give a back-end model data from our front-end and return a prediction. May 26, 2020 
For the "back-end" we need a server that supports the heavy lifting required to compute our predictions. We could use a cloud provider such as Digital Ocean or Amazon, but since we're just prototyping ideas we'll use our own local computer. May 26, 2020

Push your project until nature slaps you in the face. Then go for a walk and come back with a new philosophy. May 25, 2020 
Beautiful. Adding events to our other elements works the same way. But those elements relate to calling some back-end model to make predictions using our covid-19 data. So before adding the other events let's start working on the back-end model. May 25, 2020 
Notice we are using the data stored inside az.hold_value.fetched_data. We are also using a new Azle function called "grab_value"; this allows us to grab whatever value the user chose on an element. Let's see if it works: https://t.co/glXGwHwqzV May 25, 2020 
Now we just need to redraw the line chart instead of calling alert. Our draw_line_chart function we wrote earlier is ready to go. It already takes the data and choice as arguments and redraws the plot accordingly. So all we need to do is call draw_line_chart like this: https://t.co/4G04SR0C9c May 25, 2020 
Anything inside the "function" property gets called when the user interacts with the element. I added an alert to test it out: https://t.co/3YL3KDaWpa May 25, 2020 
To add an event to our element we use Azle's add_event function, targeting the element of choice, just as we did with styling: https://t.co/tW0mmhL0x3 May 25, 2020 
Azle has all kinds of events. We only need "click", "change", and "as_change." First, we want to redraw the line chart when the user makes a choice from the dropdown. Let's use Azle's "change" event to make this happen. https://t.co/PRRRiXq8uH May 25, 2020 
This means our interactive elements can immediately work with the data and redraw our line chart, without delay. To get our UI elements to do something we need to add "event listeners." These fire when a user interacts with our elements. Let's hook up our events now. May 25, 2020 
Add the line as above, then refresh your browser and open the browser console as before. Type az.hold_value.fetched_data into the console and hit enter. We can access our covid-19 data anytime by simply working with this object. May 25, 2020 
I will keep the returned data in a JavaScript object. I will just use Azle's namespace like this: https://t.co/18fzfOAbCm May 25, 2020 
The only purpose to creating is to provoke you into creating more. There is no final epic contribution to the world. There is only creating and learning, ad infinitum. May 25, 2020 
Software is the only business where the client needs to be convinced to spend less. May 25, 2020 
Question: How come child prodigies are only in math and music? Answer: Complexity. May 25, 2020 
...although we haven't stored any data yet. Our next step is to allow the user to select a choice (deaths, confirmed, recovered) to redraw the line chart accordingly. Let's store the returned data so we can use it as needed, without having to refetch the data each time. May 25, 2020 
We also wrote 2 function to prepare the raw data and plot the results. We are getting close: https://t.co/6vSWRJRtsN May 25, 2020 
Our covid data is now showing in the line chart. Importantly, the line chart will only be drawn when the data have been fully fetched from the REST API. To recap, we used asynchronous code in JavaScript to fetch data from an API, THEN created a visual once the data were ready. May 25, 2020 
Note: place the above 2 functions *outside* the create_azle closing parentheses. Refresh your browser and look at the application: https://t.co/zKpKeyx6LL May 25, 2020 
...and our 2 special functions like this: https://t.co/clIvmNPP95 May 25, 2020 
Be sure to keep the "hold_chart" div we added so the plot has somewhere to live. Our line chart and fetch code now look like this: https://t.co/vKEzokLMsV May 25, 2020 
We can remove the original Plotly code we added and use this function instead. It uses our first function to prepare the trace data, then plots the line chart as usual. https://t.co/DXoLZoYZed May 25, 2020 
My get_dates_and_cases function accepts the fetched data, a choice (e.g. deaths), loops through its contents, extracts the pieces I need for plotting, and returns the object for Plotly. I will write another function to draw the line chart with our prepared data. May 25, 2020 
What's important here is to understand this is not THE way to parse data. It's A way. You must experiment with JavaScript and toy around until you find something that works. Search online for how to parse JavaScript objects, loop through them, and return new structures. May 25, 2020 
Functions are how we group code in software. They have a name, accept arguments, and return some result. Functions help keep code modular and maintainable. I won't go into detail about how I arrived at this function; you can explore it yourself. May 25, 2020 
The destination structure is the trace object required by Plotly. I wrote the following function to take the raw data retrieved from fetch and convert it into the trace structure needed for Plotly: https://t.co/OtBrIlBxv3 May 25, 2020 
Let's write some JavaScript to parse the results of our fetch. We need to: 1. understand the source structure; 2. understand the destination structure. We can understand the source structure by inspecting the data in the browser console as we did previously. May 25, 2020 
Inspecting the line chart code we added earlier we can see it uses "traces" to convert raw data into lines. We need to get the data from our fetch results into these x and y properties of the trace object: https://t.co/QJhDGL5jlL May 25, 2020 
This looks a lot better than what appeared in the browser when we first pointed to the covid-19 URL. Now we can parse this data object, using its contents to populate our line chart. To do this we'll need to make a slight change to how our line chart is being drawn. May 25, 2020 
You will see an "Object" sitting in the console. This is the covid-19 data we fetched (notice the fetch API we pasted above says console.log(data)). Click repeatedly into this object to view its structure: https://t.co/6I3kiNJ3Uc May 25, 2020 
Refresh the application. The app itself doesn't look any different. But if we open the "browser console" we can see the covid-19 data we fetched. Open the browser console by right-clicking anywhere on the screen and clicking "inspect". Then click console. https://t.co/ZrW1nHhQ2D May 25, 2020 
Let's paste it into our code, using the covid-19 URL we found above (right after our Plotly code): https://t.co/4GgzaSO5az May 25, 2020 
Let's use fetch to bring our covid-19 data into our application. How do we use it? I found this: https://t.co/8pXNUfjNnd ...which shows us how: https://t.co/VT4bOzIjdp May 25, 2020 
In our case, we want to fetch covid-19 data, WAIT until it's available in our app, THEN draw our line chart. JavaScript makes all this possible via its "fetch" API. With fetch, we simply point to the URL provided by the REST service and tell it what to do once data is received. May 25, 2020 
To make sure data are available to any pieces of our app that require it we use so-called "asynchronous code." Asynchronous code WAITS until something has happened (e.g. data has been fetched) before calling a function of our choice. May 25, 2020 
While this sounds obvious it's easy to miss when one is just beginning to learn software development. As an example, when our users first load our app we want to show the line chart. But that line chart depends on data being available. May 25, 2020 
I mentioned earlier that we will ingest the REST data using JavaScript, and parse the results into some useful form. Let's do that now. An important fact about building apps that rely on fetched data is the data must be available prior to using it. May 25, 2020 
https://t.co/PUuU3uD6yM May 25, 2020 
The best actors aren’t acting. The best comedians aren’t joking. The best salesmen aren’t selling. The best ____ aren’t ____. .................. Don’t focus on the byproduct. May 25, 2020 
Now it's time to hook up events to our UI elements, and connect our fetched covid-19 data to our visuals. May 24, 2020 
Plotly provides a lot of slick stuff out of the box. We get tooltips, zooming, panning, and a host of customizable options. Doing this all yourself in raw D3 isn't fun. https://t.co/XzWEByqUUo May 24, 2020 
Looks great. If you look closely at the bottom you'll notice our section doesn't quite wrap the inner contents. Those with OCD will flip if they see that. Near the top of our app's code, go to the style_sections function and add "height" : "auto" https://t.co/5rYOW8V3vs May 24, 2020 
Notice I also changed 'myDiv' in the last line to 'hold_chart' so it targets correctly. Refresh your browser: https://t.co/HYHWQJGoMd May 24, 2020 
Notice how the last line targets "myDiv". This is an HTML element Plotly needs to attach the line chart to. Let's create that HTML element now. We use Azle's add_html function and create ourselves a "div" element. I will give the div an id called 'hold_chart' : https://t.co/YUklwGfYOF May 24, 2020 
Now we can use all of Plotly's visuals in our application. Grab the line chart code and paste it into our app: https://t.co/t3JrIqaT4c May 24, 2020 
We will copy the line chart code into our application. First, we need to make this library available. The simplest way to make a JS library available to an app is via CDN (content delivery network). We just need to add the appropriate URL to the header of our index.html file: https://t.co/yg85FTqhX7 May 24, 2020 
While you can learn D3.js itself, Plotly offers an abstraction layer that makes development (much) more rapid. Click the line chart option on Plotly's website: https://t.co/VHI7xnpKji May 24, 2020 
Starting to look like a real application now. For the line chart we will use another library called Plotly. https://t.co/ROsNy5974s Plotly is built on top of D3.js, an industry-standard visualization library written in Javascript. May 24, 2020 
Now let's add our line chart visual. We know from our mockup we need more space in the 2nd inner cell so the visual will fit properly. Let's change the "column_widths" of our inner layout: https://t.co/1H8Vp5yqkx May 24, 2020 
"halign" with "center" ensures the contents of all 3 cells align horizontally. https://t.co/UvB0FtmHB6 May 24, 2020 
Let's center the elements and remove the border from our recent layout. Change the 3 to a 0 in our layout styling and add a new function called all_style_layout. This allows us to target all elements with the same class name. https://t.co/8XOR14JuOI May 24, 2020 
Looks good: https://t.co/QK9aRwrU86 May 24, 2020 
And we'll change the button text to FORECAST: https://t.co/ZrH0H0zGrv May 24, 2020 
Let's allow up to 30 days for the prediction. Set the default to 1 week out, with min_value of 1 day and max_value 30 days: https://t.co/X5STbt64Ip May 24, 2020 
We need to tailor these elements for our app. We know the options we want for our dropdown (deaths, confirmed, recovered). Add those now: https://t.co/1aXMQbbgLV May 24, 2020 
Justified anger focuses on the pattern, not the people. May 24, 2020 
Visible science is narrative science. May 24, 2020 
Add dropdown, slider and button code to our application: https://t.co/I2tlLtUSfj May 24, 2020 
I made the border thick so I can see the new layout's cells more readily. Now let's add our UI elements inside these new cells. From Azle's documentation we can grab the code we need. https://t.co/egJjVVhbni May 24, 2020 
With data and mockup in hand we can start adding our interactive UI elements. We need a dropdown, a slider, a button, and a line chart. Let's start with the first 3. I'll add a new layout inside the first inner layout cell to help position our elements. https://t.co/tNcE5G0tAz May 24, 2020 
The user chooses a type (deaths, confirmed, recovered), with results visualized on the right in a graph. The user then chooses a "horizon" (future days) and clicks FORECAST to run a model in the back-end, whose results also get visualized when they are returned. May 24, 2020 
A dirty mockup is all we need to anchor our approach. Here's what I came up with, using Google Slides to create the sketch: https://t.co/rw4U5vo8jh May 24, 2020 
To use the data in our application we don't access it as above, rather we ingest the data using JavaScript, and parse the results into some useful form. But first, let's get back to our mockup. Now that we've seen the data, we can think about how our app might look and act. May 24, 2020 
Anytime you want to see what a REST API's data looks like just open your browser to the URL provided by the service: https://t.co/pvWimRKAi3 https://t.co/f7IXbEm0nl May 24, 2020 
REST APIs have "endpoints", which are what we point to with our browser to fetch actual data. After reviewing the documentation I found the endpoint we will use: https://t.co/pvWimRKAi3 This gives global counts for deaths, confirmed and recovered cases. May 24, 2020 
If someone offers covid-19 data as a REST API it means we don't have to store/manage the data ourselves; we can just use it 👍 I found one here: https://t.co/CWGBGGIWXx It's free and requires no authentication. Just what we want for playing around. May 24, 2020 
We want publicly-available data, ideally delivered as a "RESTful service" ("REST API"). REST APIs deliver data and functionality "over the wire" into our browser, making it easier to create interesting applications without having to write a ton of code. May 24, 2020 
*****Usual Disclaimer***** Don't be an idiot and use this model to make real-life decisions regarding a pandemic. This is just for demonstration purposes. May 24, 2020 
Most of today's interesting applications are data-driven. What kind of interesting data could we fetch, and what kind of model might we use? While I write this, covid-19 is on everyone's mind. Let's fetch covid-19 data and use a model to predict cases. May 24, 2020 
Now we're ready to add our interactive elements. We didn't start with any mockups of what we wanted to create, which is fine. But now might be a good time to think about what we want this to be. May 24, 2020 
Notice our app no longer requires any bordering. Let's make it minimal and smooth by removing the outer layout's border. I'm also going to add a subtle curve to my_section by using border-radius. https://t.co/uxFDuZM8eH May 24, 2020 
That's cleaner. However I still want some kind of separation between the 2 cells of our inner layout. Let's color the 2nd cell "Squeaky" from our Russian palette: https://t.co/I9o5tJqa7T May 24, 2020 
The app looks too "liney." Let's remove the bordering from our most recent layout: https://t.co/QaXGr8eD3O May 24, 2020 
First, let's add another layout inside our 2nd cell to hold our interactive elements. Copy the same layout code we used before, pasting it at the bottom. Target the 2nd cell of our original layout, use 1 row, 2 columns, and color the background creamy peach (or whatever): https://t.co/IgtnOzdEhI May 23, 2020 
Pretty good so far. Now things get more interesting, as our next step is adding interactive elements to our application. https://t.co/oPEc5ljWx0 May 23, 2020 
Let's increase the font size of our title, and center its alignment: https://t.co/IBj5a66eVY May 23, 2020 
Let's go ahead and show off the Ubuntu font we loaded earlier by adding a title to our application. We target the first cell of our layout and choose some text: https://t.co/YDokVxoO6c May 23, 2020 
Everything we've been adding inside the curly braces of our style functions is standard CSS styling. As you try to figure out how to achieve the styles you want you search online for the right CSS. With time you will learn many styling tricks. May 23, 2020 
I want the top row to hold my title. First, I'll change its height by targeting the first row of my layout and styling accordingly: https://t.co/L8IaxTrZqF May 23, 2020 
Since we want to arrange things on the page we will use layouts. These are just grids; boxes placed on the page, which we fill with text, buttons, sliders, inputs, etc. I'll add a layout with 2 rows and 1 column: https://t.co/J1kSDgFPIJ May 23, 2020 
This reads as "style the first element with the class name 'my_sections' using the background color I choose." I will choose Apple Valley as my color. Not sure it's any less tacky but to each their own: https://t.co/zGL1RbmT4w May 23, 2020 
A big blue section appears. Kinda tacky. Let's head back to Russia and see if we can fix that. Use the style_sections function to style our new section. Note how we are targeting the class name we gave our section ("my_sections"): https://t.co/mDQUYSnH3D May 23, 2020 
Of course nothing is on our page. Let's change that. We will add a section to hold our content. Add 1 section now and refresh your browser: https://t.co/MhrrRcMgqQ May 23, 2020 
Making progress... https://t.co/7goi8dJa5s May 23, 2020 
Refresh your browser and you'll see its new background color: https://t.co/CNx7NMkAys May 23, 2020 
Of course we need to make our Google font available. Let's load that prior to calling our style_body function (remember, docs tell you how to do stuff. Search for "font" in the docs to find the load_font function): https://t.co/o5itcAjVIS May 23, 2020 
Google fonts to the rescue: https://t.co/2XplUlecoY I'll choose Ubuntu. Nice and modern looking. Our style_body function now looks like this: https://t.co/NGkvNkx26Q May 23, 2020 
Choose your favorite color by clicking on it. Replace the "background" color in the style_body function with your new color. I'll choose Biscay. We also don't want to use standard browser fonts because the only thing worse than looking like Reddit is looking like Craigslist. May 23, 2020 
Don't be like Reddit and think you're cool cuz yer ugly. Go grab some minimalist hex codes and style your page like its 2020. Nothing says I'm modern like Russian pastel: https://t.co/urjIhvFRiz https://t.co/x1ekXpEhjD May 23, 2020 
Let's style the page. Good docs tell you how to use their syntax. Go grab the style_body code and paste it into your index.html file. https://t.co/tG7xVMacy6 May 23, 2020 
If you right-click the index.html file and choose your browser you can view the page. Doing that now will pop open your browser and show a blank page. https://t.co/zoUhxYEAhd May 23, 2020 
Every web application has an index.html file. It's the "page" your browser points to. Let's place the file in a folder called my_app, and drag your index.html file into this folder: https://t.co/Dz4tnDMzJ3 May 23, 2020 
Go to https://t.co/CCQ3fkeYjl and click on the STARTER HTML icon in the top left. Copy and paste this into notepad (I am using TextWrangler, same idea), then save the file as index.html (on your Desktop). https://t.co/Kawg65Nbp6 May 23, 2020 
People rarely write programs from the ground up anymore. That's too slow. Today we use libraries. We will use JavaScript and Python libraries. I will choose Azle for front-end stuff and Flask for back-end stuff. Let's start with our page. Pages always have an index.html file May 23, 2020 
You only need a browser, a notepad, and your computer's terminal (command prompt on PC). There are a few high-level pieces that go into building all applications: - a page - styles - layouts - interactive elements - events - server - fetching/storing data Let's cover these: May 23, 2020 
Anyone can build a basic application, with all the major pieces needed to seed more elaborate projects and learning down the road. Software is about expression. If you want to express your ideas with more than just form, you need to add function. Let's get started. May 23, 2020 
Get Started Building Software (in 1 twitter thread) I believe everyone should build. Building is the only real validation of our ideas. There is no better way to learn. Today, that usually means software. I think of software as today's woodworking. Today's metalsmithing. May 23, 2020

Great writing is always at risk of contradicting itself. It doesn’t bore you with its attempt to tie up loose ends. Great writing leaves openings, unfinished ideas, unpolished remarks. Great writing involves the reader whether they like it or not. https://t.co/H5RemFzqqG May 23, 2020 
@MDiPaolaMD Bingo. It's largely what got them to where they are. May 23, 2020 
@Suhail https://t.co/zcb2wkpFSf May 23, 2020 
4/4 Academics end up trying to formalize what practitioners found through execution. They are collectors of past successes, waiting for the next discovery to be made outside the ivory towers. May 23, 2020 
3/4 This is why most academic models are useless. You can’t “get them out the door” because they have been built with too much thought and not enough grit. May 23, 2020 
2/4 Practitioners build models that must work, which means viewing the world as multiplicative and interdependent. Practitioners know that every addition causes an exponential explosion in complexity that is exceedingly difficult to reign-in from a practical perspective. May 23, 2020 
1/4 Why has academia largely failed to partner with industry? Because academics add things, while practitioners remove things. Academics build models that tell stories, which means viewing the world in terms of additive and independent variables. May 23, 2020 
The overwhelming majority of prominent scientists, engineers, artists and athletes talk about politics instead of their craft. The reason? People talk about what they excel in. May 23, 2020 
People will learn to look learned, invest to be rich, talk for attention. The things most people want are often achieved by those with little interest in the same. People who work for their prosperity focus on what matters, everything else is byproduct. Don’t chase byproducts. May 23, 2020 
Quality requires quantity. May 23, 2020 
Nature doesn't require a resolution to the objectivism / relativism debate. This is just human bickering of no consequence to the evolution of species. Time will keep what works and filter what doesn't. No more. No less. May 22, 2020 
To-do lists, schedules, etc. All inflexible constructs that work against your natural capacity to perform. If it's important, you'll remember it. If a forgotten deadline pops up, the forced brevity will make your work authentically clean. Just stay focused on what is *you*. https://t.co/tO0YFoNe97 May 22, 2020 
Great to see people adding projects. Keep it going. Doesn’t have to be epic. Just get your hands dirty. https://t.co/bE55LCnnvP May 22, 2020 
50s to 80s had post-war appreciation for new found convenience and comfort. End of the millennium saw an inflection point, where excess comfort displaced appreciation. New millennium saw appreciation all but lost, diluted by decadence. Will there be a post-virus appreciation? May 22, 2020 
The model of freedom doesn’t come without costs. If you want local autonomy then you must accept a level of loss. You don’t get to revert to top-down policy every time the loss hits home. Freedom isn’t always pretty. May 21, 2020 
Expanding the computational universe towards discovery requires massive variation and that demands an open model. May 21, 2020 
Decrepit paradigms aren’t going to work here. The academic model cannot bring science into the world of software; It needs scaled contribution from varied backgrounds; This does not (cannot) happen with licensed software; https://t.co/cPfHHujo0X May 21, 2020 
3/3 - Computation must be accepted as experimentation (it’s happening, slowly but surely); - As anyone studying complexity knows, TOE cannot be found in physics alone. May 21, 2020 
2/3 - It needs to not only succeed where incumbent models have, it needs to showcase a larger range of validity; - the current approach to creating hypergraphs then arbitrarily making some analogy to existing theory is too weak (and convenient); May 21, 2020 
@stephen_wolfram ‘s new Physics Project is the correct approach, but will need to contend with the following: 1/3 - Mathematica is still a paywall. It does not open work to the general community of computing scientists (needs to be open source; should be in Python). May 21, 2020 
There’s a reason the expression “without loss of generality” only exists in mathematics. https://t.co/uVdqUq5fSd May 21, 2020 
Being productive and content at the same time can seem unworkable, until you spot a deep commonality. Both operate best via the removal of apprehension. May 20, 2020 
3/3 Those who make an impact form the negative space inside the expectations of others. May 20, 2020 
2/3 Struggling students solve outside the box. Effective teachers diverge from the curriculum. Influential scientists counter consensus. Compelling authors break expectations. The confident confront their fears. May 20, 2020 
1/3 Things are impressed upon people through juxtaposition. Concepts are revealed when they touch that which they are not. Those who live lives of contrast often outdo their colleagues. May 20, 2020 
@aaronggreen @trishankkarthik @erenasena3 @sdhoff95 @spartanowner1 @JBclear Of course. May 19, 2020 
@meoyawn It's not about building directly from the content. There is no way to know how something might influence your project. Countless ideas and concepts interacting in complex ways to produce some new combination in your mind that you can express tangibly. Just consume and build. May 19, 2020 
Fame is achieved when one’s idiosyncratic bullshit gets perceived as incontestable genius. https://t.co/HrLtW6eaTn May 19, 2020 
When you build stuff it’s always at risk of collapsing under its own weight. You can’t skim, ignore, or misinterpret without nature immediately teaching you a lesson. Nature is action, feedback and adaptation. There is nothing more innate than flexing your creative spirit. May 19, 2020 
2/2 https://t.co/YMKea7sXdj https://t.co/oyclyZoEpl May 19, 2020 
1/2 I’ll play, but with a modification to the rules. 6 books - 6 people - 2 projects @trishankkarthik @erenasena3 @aaronggreen @sdhoff95 @spartanowner1 @JBclear PROJECTS (see video) - GUI-fying the Manim math engine - extending Wolfram’s physics hypergraphs to 3D worlds https://t.co/W4JTpp6QY6 https://t.co/mL9KJpo1rB May 19, 2020 
@JoshHochschild Sure. But each of those still contribute. Regardless how one decides to facet the description of cause (as Aquinas and others did) it still represents some casual fragment, albeit insufficient to capture the totality of explanation. May 18, 2020 
@JoshHochschild And of course this is not “dependence” which is used arbitrarily to describe a relation between variables that may or may not be spurious. May 18, 2020 
@JoshHochschild If the event “depends” on the process then you are stating it is “a” cause, just not the complete cause. The single cause is insufficient to fully explain the phenomenon in question. If there is absolutely no causal contribution then there is no “depends.” May 18, 2020 
@JoshHochschild Has a number of names: - fallacy of the single cause - fallacy of complex cause - causal oversimplification - causal reductionism - reduction fallacy https://t.co/7zft7gDJnh May 18, 2020 
@aaronggreen Awesomeness. May 18, 2020 
@RubenGao And remember... https://t.co/CMZdLCMRNd May 18, 2020 
@RubenGao Symbols are merely concepts anchored to aid the researcher in moving through a thought process. The rules of mathematics reflect whatever consistency exists in that particular formulation. Equations lead to more equations, thoughts lead to more thoughts. Math is but one approach. May 18, 2020 
If you want to dismantle something, you need to embrace it, excel in it, then destroy it from the inside. There are no sour grapes when you know the enemy better than they know themselves. May 18, 2020 
People disinterested in mathematics are manipulating the same thoughts in their mind as those sympathetic to analysis, they just don't use/require such explicit encodings to anchor their thinking. May 18, 2020 
A life restricted by its opinions is a long winded tragedy. May 18, 2020 
@digvijoy_c Beautiful. And exactly right. When we are no longer forced to create worlds in our mind we dismantle the only thing that matters; being part of the experience. May 17, 2020 
@aaronggreen Yes, this is precisely what I am saying. May 17, 2020 
@aaronggreen What is that? May 17, 2020 
In our push towards decadence we offload cognitive effort. Radio to cable to streaming. 2-D to 3-D to AR. Textbooks to VR. When all the work is done for you there is nothing left to imagine. There is no *you* left in the experience. Humanity has never been so uninvolved. May 17, 2020

No 2 pianists sound the same, despite playing the exact same sheet music. This is because interpretation lives in the gaps, expressing what wasn't encoded. You can't get passionate about *what* you do. Many others are doing the same thing. Passion comes from *how* you do it. May 17, 2020 
@ole_b_peters Life is made of many things, and we must decide to act; A common way is to take the average, and treat this number as fact; But a person’s life is not one thing, for a life is episodic; The sum of one’s life is the same as the crowd’s, only when things are ergodic. May 17, 2020

Engaged the world flawed. Your faults yield higher returns on investment than stale virtues. Imperfections have sticking points. They grab onto the status quo, forcing the contrast necessary to provoke progress. May 15, 2020 
@mattfahrner @yaakosine The charge isn't against the activity of science. It's against the misappropriation of the word to prop up narratives. Those who disdain reliance on science are usually arguing against its misuse. May 15, 2020 
@digvijoy_c It’s not more thinking that leads to better thoughts, it’s more exposure to things that place you in juxtaposition to some universal truth. In this sense everyone has the same available time, but not the same available contrast. May 15, 2020 
Remove the word “science” from today’s discourse and people would be forced to reason about what they read. May 15, 2020

Today’s abstraction democratizes technology, inviting many to unleash their creativity. It’s the right and inevitable thing to do. But one thing is undeniable. Today’s tech doesn’t look like “tech.“ Tech will never again be as cool as it was in the 80s. May 12, 2020 
@meoyawn People tend to buy based on what they want to hear, not what they need to hear. This doesn't mean value and psychology can't be aligned, but as far as a proxy goes, I see money mapping directly to psychology. May 12, 2020 
Money isn’t a proxy for value, it’s a proxy for psychology. May 12, 2020 
Each day is fueled by the momentum you built the previous day, each month by previous months. Be deliberate with the momentum you're building. Momentum is harder to undo than it is to profit from. May 12, 2020 
Consumption is linear. People understand concepts when presented in a straight line. Creating is nonlinear. The novel has no preexisting trajectory. There is no story that can convey the deep meaning behind actualizing ideas. Go 👏 Build 👏 May 12, 2020 
If you must seek advice, find it in people who have no understanding of what you do. They can only speak to that which is universal. Framing your life around abstract truths has far more utility than attempting to recreate another’s path. May 11, 2020 
Few things hold you back as much as believing in your own legend. Stop trying to be epic. May 11, 2020 
@to_your_point An emergent property is a behaviour found at higher levels of organization as a *result* of interactions at a lower level. Thus higher levels do not directly enforce how lower levels behave. Government should be an outgrowth of local activity maintaining beneficial solutions. May 11, 2020 
Whenever you read something scientific stated as fact you should realistically read it as: An irreproducible study was done using convenient statistics, peer-reviewed by a board that promotes career-boosting narratives. If you can show the opposite then by all means believe it. May 11, 2020 
@aaronggreen @NatlGovsAssoc @ASTHO It would be good to address these assumptions from an epistemological standpoint. May 11, 2020 
@aaronggreen @NatlGovsAssoc @ASTHO Thanks. - assumes measurements are accurate and representative (e.g. no new local (within community) transmission for 14 consecutive days); - assumes top-down rules will be implemented locally (e.g. Import of goods by delivery to a designated cargo border location) May 11, 2020 
7/n Bottom-up/organic/local dynamism operating freely against the fixed truths of nature is how complexity works. The hubris in suggesting human experts can outsmart nature is wholly unfounded. May 11, 2020 
6/n Thus the system is designed to promote sterile, laboratory-style “expertise” into positions that enforce uninformed rules. The epistemic restrictions on understanding *how* complex systems solve their problems is absolute. The only expert is nature. May 11, 2020 
5/n An unfortunate reality in today’s society is the trust placed in “experts” without hesitation. What is an “expert”? Someone elevated by a system that places those with knowledge in positions of power. How was that knowledge obtained? Schooling. May 11, 2020 
4/n Top-down systems have no access to the only resource that can produce the information necessary to solve complex challenges. Democratically elected officials are there to ensure local autonomy, not to enforce uninformed, ever-changing rules driven by political interests. May 11, 2020 
3/n All human activity exists well outside sterile, laboratory-style scenarios. Entrusting the opaque and complex to solve problems is framed as unsophisticated and risky due to its lack of narrative. But it is narrative that holds great risk, as it isn’t informed by nature. May 11, 2020 
2/n If the rules are themselves dynamic (policies, interventions) then you are not operating as nature does. If you believe in top-down dynamism you are suggesting humans can solve problems better than nature. Outside exceedingly narrow domains this has never been the case. May 11, 2020 
1/n Bottom-up/organic/local is to be entrusted to solve problems. “Why?” Because everything in nature shows this to be true. “But nature has rules!” Yes but those rules are immovable. An unchanging backdrop to endless bottom-up dynamism. May 11, 2020 
It’s easier to call what you don’t understand “genius” than to invest the time discovering it is anything but. And as such, our world is littered with “geniuses.” May 11, 2020

The biggest productivity boost is finding ways to make any task enjoyable. This requires deep self awareness, to map your intrinsic talents to the requirements of a task. Focusing on what you “should be doing” won’t matter until you’ve mastered mapping your talents to tasks. May 08, 2020

@ErikByronTaylor Constraints are indeed key, but if they are placed at too low a level (too specific to the problem) then they don’t allow for offshoot discoveries. Humans developed an array of abilities with no goal but survival. A very high-level “constraint” compared to say recognizing objects May 05, 2020 
AI is based on goal-oriented approaches, minimizing the distance inside an objective. But human abilities emerged as byproducts of unrelated intentions. What keeps today’s “AI” so narrowly useful is not the limitations of the machine but the constraints imposed on it by man. May 04, 2020

13/n The assumed VC track needs to be dramatically reduced for the model to change. Tomorrow’s builders need to be incentivized to create markets, not push someone else’s needle a little further. Apr 28, 2020 
12/n I think VCs do far more harm than good when it comes to promoting innovation. Their quickest-route-to-ROI approach shifts the focus away from genuine problem-solving towards bland feature improvement. Apr 28, 2020 
11/n Humans are not meant to throw ideas at already-solved problems in order to deepen some large organization’s pockets. They are meant to take actual challenges and resolve them through their ingenuity. This is something Silicon Valley used to stand for. Apr 28, 2020 
10/n Problem-focused building is something society has largely lost. When PCs first hit the stage there was no market for personal computers, it got created. Same with a host of other great innovations, including the first smartphone. Apr 28, 2020 
9/n Market creation requires coming out with a product that is not only entirely new but has undeniable advantages to society. Market creation requires companies to look at *problems* that actually need solving, rather than building to please investors and incumbents. Apr 28, 2020 
8/n If we are going to break this model, small companies need to move away from supposed product/market differentiation and towards market creation. This obviously isn’t anything a VC would be interested in but that’s a good thing. Apr 28, 2020 
7/n If we take product differentiation out of the equation then why bother starting a company? Running a business becomes nothing more than optimizing a small sales and distribution pipeline for a rehashed product that slightly improves on some larger company’s feature. Apr 28, 2020 
6/n Smaller companies thus don’t really compete on product differentiation, and they cannot compete on what matters; scaling their sales and distribution. Apr 28, 2020 
5/n So-called “product differentiation” isn’t what’s happening in software, rather it’s how well one scales their sales and distribution that makes or breaks a company. Take any leading product and compare it to the next few in line; they are the same thing. Apr 28, 2020 
4/n Just as markets are efficient, product knowledge spreads at the speed of light, immediately equalizing the product landscape the moment a company comes out of stealth mode. Apr 28, 2020 
3/n Accepting slower growth is supposed to mean making something better, but better how? Are the products produced by smaller firms better? Apr 28, 2020 
2/n Attempts to break this model usually focus around bootstrapping, enabling companies to grow organically, from the bottom-up; albeit much more slowly than their VC-back counterparts. Apr 28, 2020 
1/n VCs only want to invest in startups that can be bought by incumbents, otherwise they don’t foresee ROI. So if you are dealing with a VC-backed startup you can be fairly certain they are doing nothing innovative, for reasons depicted in my original tweet. https://t.co/NQZvZ0lLsT Apr 28, 2020 
@tib Indeed. The fact that innovation is dead is a sign we’re on the cusp of a new model. There is no progress without the death of what’s current. Whole lotta boring rehashed unimaginative software out there. Looking forward to something very different. Apr 28, 2020 
Innovation is dead. Why? Big companies only add to what currently makes them money. Small companies now exist for the sole purpose of being bought by large companies.

15/n Ultimately, nature will decide how much progress is allowed. https://t.co/TiNKHkKmM2 Apr 19, 2020 
14/n We rarely take precaution when moving forward. This virus was inevitable. There will be many more. Maybe the real question is this: do we really need such levels of economic "progress"? Apr 19, 2020 
13/n Cost-benefit is going to inevitably creep-in regardless. Ultimately, this comes down to the cost humanity is paying, for what most of us call progress. We increase connectivity by building trade routes and supply chains and travel industries, all in the pursuit of growth. Apr 19, 2020 
12/n This asymmetry suggests cost-benefit analysis is largely inappropriate. But can it really get so bad that most humans die? Preliminary data suggests not. Can't we just isolate the elderly? Can't we run antibody tests and get things started again? Apr 19, 2020 
11/n Is cost-benefit analysis appropriate with so many unknowns? Perhaps not. There are far more unknowns with the virus then there are with the economy. The economy will survive with most businesses killed off, but if all humans die there is nothing. Apr 19, 2020 
10/n Tragedy breeds innovation. Systems respond to stressors. Apr 19, 2020 
9/n Any given node (business) is not needed for the economy to function through time, what is needed is the *renewal* of nodes. Not great news for today's businesses (who don't have buffer capital) but nevertheless it is not the death of the economy. Apr 19, 2020 
8/n If you believe in multiplicative process and complex adaptive systems then you can remove the overwhelming majority of nodes without killing the system. Apr 19, 2020 
7/n The last 2 points don't mean many lives won't be ruined. But wiping out a large portion of the economy is not the same as killing the economy. Apr 19, 2020 
6/n 2) Also, the economy doesn't require its *transmission* of information via biological entities (infectious agents using living hosts). Today, the internet can support a decent amount of economic activity. Apr 19, 2020 
5/n Complex networks can survive almost complete removal of minor nodes as long as major hubs are intact. Apr 19, 2020 
4/n Complex systems are robust or antifragile to minor node removal, but fragile to major node removal. Small businesses are not highly connected (relatively speaking) and represent minor nodes, despite collectively representing the majority of the economy. Apr 19, 2020 
3/n But there are 2 major differences between lockdown and economic downturn worth considering. 1) Today, major nodes are still intact (e.g. grocery stores, gas stations, hospitals, financial institutions, etc.) Apr 19, 2020 
2/n The economy/market is undoubtedly complex, and will exhibit similar patterns to what we see in biological systems. If we cut off major nodes in the economy there will be dramatic consequences that multiply in ways we cannot predict. Apr 19, 2020

@iangray @ishirubi @DrPhil @paulportesi @GordonFang1 @aaronggreen @ryankon deaths, new cases Apr 17, 2020 
@GordonFang1 9/n We can start talking about removing dominos to stop the spread but I think I’ve stretched the domino analogy far enough. Hopefully it helps explain COVID-19 growth dynamics at a high level, and the loose connection to scale invariance. Apr 17, 2020 
@GordonFang1 8/n But the good news is scale invariant networks also have a “flaw” in their makeup; there exist “hubs” of high connectivity that are highly susceptible. If we remove these hubs (think super spreaders) then the ability of the network to be robust/antifragile) diminishes. Apr 17, 2020 
@GordonFang1 7/n Imagine removing a node from the internet. Does the web collapse? Nope. It is much more likely that any node that is attacked/removed has low connectivity. So from a probabilistic perspective the network is likely to survive. Apr 17, 2020 
@GordonFang1 6/n Systems that don’t depend on size are typically robust (more likely antifragile) and thus highly adaptive. This is because their structural and/or dynamical properties remain largely unchanged despite stressors (or get better in some sense). Apr 17, 2020 
@GordonFang1 5/n Many things in nature exhibit scale-invariant traits, including the durations and sizes of outbreaks. Outbreaks obviously grow rapidly with population size. This is the hallmark of large fluctuations characteristic of heavy tails inside power-law distributions. Apr 17, 2020 
@GordonFang1 4/n Imagine the number of deaths growing by multiplying the current infected population by the same number again-and-again. Apr 17, 2020 
@GordonFang1 3/n The dominos that continually fall have some acceptable mass that makes it all possible (if the next domino was too heavy it wouldn’t fall) and are thus shown to “grow” in size at a fixed rate; ergo they are multiplied by some constant factor. Apr 17, 2020 
@GordonFang1 2/n So if a system needs to look the same at both small and big scales then there must exist some common factor that keeps multiplying the smallest version of itself. Apr 17, 2020 
@GordonFang1 1/n Scale invariance occurs when some property about the system does not change when we zoom in or out. The property doesn’t change because it is being multiplied by a common factor (the factor “grows” the property, but it’s just a bigger version of the same thing). Apr 17, 2020 
@GordonFang1 @DrPhil @paulportesi @aaronggreen @ryankon Lol. Wanted to showcase the perspective with some dramatic flare (green virus thingies are really big). Apr 17, 2020 
https://t.co/PLkFQR9H52 Apr 17, 2020 
Each domino is X times larger than predecessor. They "grow" at a fixed rate. Runs on a magnification/growth factor (e.g. r = 1.5) A series of 13 dominoes that grow at this rate will amplify the force needed to push the smallest by a factor of 2 billion. Is scale invariant. Apr 17, 2020 
When people don't get it, force the analogy. Green = COVID-19 Grey = car/swimming accidents If my simulation with helicopter sounds doesn't save you than perhaps Darwin wants you "removed" @DrPhil @paulportesi @GordonFang1 @aaronggreen @ryankon https://t.co/7hPeKZvuar Apr 17, 2020

12/12 Also have to be careful here. False narratives easily emerge when looking at patterns on a screen. How so we ensure these slices and patterns are not convenient ways to find what we want? Apr 14, 2020 
11/12 It seems appropriate to treat these shapes as "experimental subjects", with probability and info theory applied to understand them statistically. This precludes the reductionist's dream of understanding some logical unbroken chain between input and output. Apr 14, 2020 
10/12 A major question is: Are there limitations to interpreting nature geometrically? This approach rests on geometric interpretations given its analysis of structures created via simple rules. What might be left out? Apr 14, 2020 
9/12 With relativity we only get to assess spatial curvature at the high level. But the "particle approach" deals with curvature at the lowest level. This seems like a natural bridge between QM and GR. Apr 14, 2020 
8/12 Stephen discussed identifying particles (perhaps those lighter than electrons). Can these new particles be measured/determined via the curvatures found within these shapes? Apr 14, 2020 
7/12 Stephen showed cuts through graphs as a way to describe properties like energy. Perhaps the lowest level of the graph is the discrete manifestation of QM, with higher levels showing the abstraction into continuous GR. Also connects to Shannon entropy: QM level = more info Apr 14, 2020 
6/12 Teasing out causal invariance over these shapes is interesting. Causal topology must have an important role here. It seems like an important level of abstraction with which to understand these structures and their temporal implications. Apr 14, 2020 
5/12 You could also use a proxy to space curvature such as time dilation. Show that dilation matches what's expected. (Wolfram ended up addressing this). Apr 14, 2020 
4/12 I wonder if a Deep Neural Network could find latent similarities between these shapes (intra and inter). Much of the interpretation seems to rely on pattern recognition inside shapes and towards nature. Apr 14, 2020 
3/12 It would be great to have some distance metric between the shapes you create with this approach and known shapes in nature (some connection between the isomorphic classes of nature's shapes and those generated here). Apr 14, 2020

1/12 Great talk by @stephen_wolfram introducing his Physics Project (https://t.co/14UEhOiwMZ) Important work here; goes well-beyond physics. I hope upcoming generations of scientists pay close attention. Some of my quick thoughts: Apr 14, 2020 
@nntaleb @stephen_wolfram Resistance to computational approaches is unfortunately alive and well across all traditional sciences. Wolfram's work is hugely important. It will take a new generation to push this work forward. Apr 14, 2020 
Liberal The system makes you poor and keeps you poor. Conservative Your attitude makes you poor and keeps you poor. Truth Successful people find ways to make their attitude work with the system. Positive change cannot emerge from commentary; it requires participation. Apr 14, 2020 
6/6 Bad science is far worse than no science. If you cannot source enough data, and use appropriate models and validation, then don’t do the study. Most truly complex phenomena are best understood using natural heuristics, not career-boosting “science.” Apr 14, 2020 
5/6 The epistemic restrictions that are fundamental to truly complex systems precludes the utility of simplistic models influencing decision making and policy. And yet these are the models that sway policy the most since they overlap with political and social constructs. Apr 14, 2020 
4/6 Social scientists can be dangerous because they must attempt to model the highly complex using scant, poorly sourced data. This forces them to rely on simplistic models that must be “legitimized” by in-sample fitting. Apr 14, 2020 
3/6 Slapping lines across data and using “best fit” to defend a model’s validity is just eye candy. It immediately triggers our pattern-finding impulse, causing many to accept fraudulent “results.” Apr 14, 2020

@joe_shipman There's the ratio pi(x) / x/log(x) which must have a limit of 1 asymptotically (Gauss and Legendre), with some strength added to this statement via analysis of prime factors and the size of N! Warmer? Colder? Apr 12, 2020 
@joe_shipman Can use the method of Chebyshev & Erdos, utilizing the product of factorials that yield an integer, thus tracking the divisibility of large prime factors. This puts it on the interval (n,2n], and would provide both lower and upper bounds. Is there something diff here? Apr 12, 2020

@dreemer08 @nntaleb 2/2 Since we are talking multiplicative growth, adding more exposed individuals to a population can have explosive increases in confirmed cases. Decreasing exposure by even a small amount can "explosively decrease" the number of infected. Apr 12, 2020

7/7 Only by legitimizing our work internally can our lives be a depiction of our true potential. Mar 31, 2020 
6/7 Outward-facing accomplishments are ephemeral, with little persistence beyond the intermittent bouts of pride that wane exponentially. Enduring satisfaction comes from deep self-awareness regarding what we do and why. Mar 31, 2020 
5/7 An externally-validated life runs counter to what matters because it forces us to fashion our lives around the ignorance of others. This places an upper bound on genuine accomplishment, ensuring our work never exceeds the blind expectations of others. Mar 31, 2020 
4/7 We are easily impressed by what we don’t understand since it exists in juxtaposition to our own accomplishments. But when we spend time deconstructing the works of others these feats quickly lose their mystique. Mar 31, 2020 
3/7 Those who are impressed by a book don’t recognize it as a rehashed version of what already exists. Those impressed by someone’s salary don’t realize what was forfeited to obtain it. Those impressed by a publication record don’t see the politics that guaranteed it. Mar 31, 2020 
2/7 What all external validations have in common is they materialize from the ignorance of others. If someone is enamored by another person’s accomplishments it’s only because they don’t see the achievement for what it really is. Mar 31, 2020 
External Validation and Ignorance 1/7 We go through life wanting to impress others. Measuring our self-worth by external factors. Salary, books/papers published, public recognition, etc. Mar 31, 2020

@Thomas_w_Gagnon Yes, many hear about entrprnrs working 10+ hours, feeling guilty they don’t do the same. Nobody actually “works” those hours. In fact, you can run the experiment yourself.

@stewarthu @yudapearl @HarryDCrane This has nothing to do with comparing authors. Nobody owns trial-and-error or causality. This has to do with nature and our ability to reason effectively about what generates what we see. Mar 17, 2020 
Be far more skeptical of those who chase causes than those who chase viability. Mar 17, 2020 
@yudapearl @HarryDCrane ...and instead embrace trial-and-error and adaptive heuristics. Look at today’s abysmal scientific replication crisis, or the naive policy interventions by academics that do far more harm than good. It is the clinging to *story* that degrades quality science. Mar 17, 2020 
@yudapearl @HarryDCrane It has always been opaque. Human progress has not required discovering deep causal reasons, those get layered-on by academics after the fact, mostly as false narratives. It’s all too human to seek agency. We can’t resist. Forthcoming paradigms will do away with chasing causes... Mar 17, 2020

8/8 As long as we continue to teach math as a tool of detached reasoning, it will remain a lifeless topic in the minds of almost everyone. If the cost of embracing abstraction is the complete abandonment of instinct we have achieved far less than the academic narrative suggests. Mar 09, 2020 
7/8 A teacher whose training goes no deeper than the dry routines humans are built to loathe ensures today’s math education selects for a very narrow range of individuals. Mar 09, 2020 
6/8 The majority of students are not attracted to math because operating solely in the abstract is wholly unnatural. Far worse, most of today’s teachers instruct using the same shallow learning that plagues today’s students. Mar 09, 2020 
5/8 Today’s math education involves learning relations between hollow abstractions; training the mind to memorize steps that maneuver detached concepts from a vacant starting point to an indifferent ending. Mar 09, 2020 
4/8 But abstraction comes at a great cost. It removes the natural associations humans require to discern meaning. To operate solely in the abstract chokes off one’s ability to fashion analogies to real life. Mar 09, 2020 
3/8 Abstraction brings with it great power. By abstracting properties we find universal rules absent the explicit connection to physical reality, and the messiness such tethering brings. Mar 09, 2020 
2/8 Eventually adjectives were attached to varied objects like a “green stone” or “as many things as fingers on a hand.” The final step saw properties abstracted from objects altogether. “Green” and “five” were their own concepts. Mar 09, 2020 
Detached Reasoning Leads to a Natural Distaste For Mathematics 1/8 Humans began with numbers as concrete associations to physical things, by comparing objects. Green was grass, 10 was the number of fingers. Mar 09, 2020

@Thalesdisciple m/s is a kinematic derived “unit.” Same with m/s squared, cubed, fourth.

@spartanowner1 @paulportesi When you go deep in a few things, thnking deeply, avoiding distractions, they are enriched heavily by your messy distractions. The 80 feeds the 20. https://t.co/67MkM8lk6a Feb 18, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi I think what we find counterintuitive is that the balance isn’t 50/50. Humans suck at concentration, it’s not natural. What percentage of the day could you spend meditating? Deep, still, focused thought IS critical, but ONLY in bursts of short concentrated effort. Feb 18, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi ...you will be building “toxins” that rob you of time better spent elsewhere. This is why your tail should be tasks you easily *toss*. Remember, nature says yes to almost everything, but it tosses almost all of it away. Don’t be dualistic. You need both disc & scrappy mess. Feb 18, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi the system. But on your most important tasks you should be going deep. https://t.co/SPleOeG360 You want momentum to keep “piling up” allowing your learning and productivity to compound. So your discipline should be applied here, but only here. If you pile up the tail ... Feb 18, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi That’s why discipline is so important, but ONLY on the tasks most central to your career/passion. People will attempt to apply discipline to every task (block out noise, start the clock, etc.). This will always fail. People are messy, organic. Structuring the complex breaks ... Feb 18, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi 8/8 Nature has already figured out what works. Don’t fight her. Feb 17, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi 7/8 This is how “the 80 fuels the 20.” You benefit from massive variation but are only invested in the few high momentum tasks that benefit from that variation. Feb 17, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi Your peak thus represents a few high momentum projects near and dear to you, while your tail represents the many impromptu tasks that come in and out of your day (e.g. distractions). https://t.co/OpVG16FXwB Feb 17, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi 5/8 You should have very few projects with high momentum. Too many means you’re not self-aware of what truly drives you. But you should have many ad hoc projects that come and go. Feb 17, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi 4/8 The question is what gets “paretoed”? Number of tasks? Time spend on tasks? Intensity applied to tasks? I argue its momentum. A project has high momentum if you touch it every day. Feb 17, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi 3/8 Like anything important in life, it’s best not to think dualistically. Distractions are good to a point. Structure is good to a point. Too much of either will kill you. Dose response. Feb 17, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi 2/8 Nature exhibits pareto-esque distributions for a reason. It needs to tap into variation (surprisal) to make serendipitous discoveries, but those discoveries must benefit some structured goal. Feb 17, 2020 
@spartanowner1 @paulportesi 1/8 If you over-manage your distractions you’ll miss out on the surprisal needed to fuel creative efforts. But, if everything is unstructured you’ll fail to maintain momentum on your most important tasks. Feb 17, 2020

6/6 It is the paradigm’s unwillingness to embrace more appropriate methods that keep soft practitioners forever chasing a version of depth and thoroughness they cannot attain. Feb 15, 2020 
5/6 There are insurmountable epistemological barriers that will forever remain, under naive reductionism. But this does not rule out the possibility of anchoring soft fields rigorously. Feb 15, 2020 
4/6 The building and organizing of knowledge must center on methods that set out to quantify uncertainty, not justify a proposed model championed by convenience. Feb 15, 2020 
3/6 Only probability and information theory are capable of this detachment. This is because they attempt to quantify only what nature makes available, regardless its origin. Feb 15, 2020 
2/6 This doesn’t preclude the possibility of commenting on possible entities and behavior. But measurements must be regarded as an informational proxy to a generator you’ll never know intimately. Feb 15, 2020

Pareto doesn't work if you only keep the 20 and forget the 80. Companies mistakenly hire only for the attributes of the 20. People mistakenly focus only on "high ROI" projects in the 20. The 80 is what feeds the 20. Via variation. Also mobility. Who is in the 20 varies. Feb 09, 2020 
Systems that require no fitness (however defined) from its members artificially remove the benefit that massive variation ordinarily brings. Giving voice to the spineless isn’t diversity, it’s disease. https://t.co/G19QkuUxN1 Feb 09, 2020

@spartanowner1 3/3 There are also autodidacts inside university. I felt my learning experience was very self-owned. Others relied on professors to guide them. At the end of the day, wherever you choose to be, real learning will come down to you owning your education. Feb 02, 2020 
@spartanowner1 2/3 The PhD undoubtedly opened doors job-wise. But it also gives me cred to say people don't need one if they're looking to set out on their own. Feb 02, 2020 
@spartanowner1 1/3 Depends on what you're looking to do. If you want to do research in a university you'll need the PhD for their requirements. Again, you have to separate job requirements from mastering a craft. Feb 02, 2020

@spartanowner1 11/12 Some people like to be presented with the topics. They think a foundation must precede action. I disagree. Your foundation emerges from struggle, not by having it presented to you. Those with a lot of building exp are miles ahead of CS degrees, bootcamps, etc. No question. Jan 31, 2020 
@spartanowner1 10/12 If this is you then bootcamps will help you. They can present you with industry-standard topics, and provide projects (but they are not "real" projects; you have endless support and things known to work. It's not the same. Remember stressors.) Jan 31, 2020 
@spartanowner1 9/12 The best way is to jump in and start building. This doesn't make bootcamps useless. Most people lack the passion (yes I believe you need passion) to *want* to build. They are perfectly happy to be given a task and perform that task as needed. Jan 31, 2020 
@spartanowner1 8/12 When you truly understand something it is largely intuitive, because it was an impression made on you while struggling to create something that survives the real world. Jan 31, 2020 
@spartanowner1 7/12 The former means a concept was presented to you in a sterile fashion, absent any real-world stressors. There is no genuine imprinting of the concept. Jan 31, 2020 
@spartanowner1 6/12 Yes, fundamentals are important. BUT...there are 2 ways to learn them. You can begin as students do, learning them in vacuum. Or you can learn them in-context, as they arise from building real applications. The 2 approaches are not comparable. Jan 31, 2020 
@spartanowner1 5/12 So you have to separate job-seeking from the art of your craft. Getting jobs is easy. Regurgitate to the hiring manager and keep smiling. But to be happy, and love what you do; this is not something a company can give you. This is something you must create for yourself. Jan 31, 2020 
@spartanowner1 4/12 The reality is, when you're first getting into the industry you're going to be a cog; period. If you want to get hired you'll need to memorize sterile isolated facts about programming (or UX). But getting the job and living your craft are different things. Jan 31, 2020 
@spartanowner1 3/12 Cog work is not mastery. As explained in my Quora answer here (see excerpt in pic): https://t.co/A7Fw9i1Olq Jan 31, 2020 
@spartanowner1 2/12 Companies, particularly large ones, hire "cogs." You fit into an existing recipe that has made the company money for years. Cog work is highly-focused labor that allows companies to scale by division of work. Jan 31, 2020 
@spartanowner1 1/12 First, we have to be clear. Mastering a craft and doing what's needed to get a job are 2 very different things. Jan 31, 2020

The source of hype in AI is our projection of narratives onto its outputs. If AI writes a poem we find meaning. If it paints we see art. It makes sound we hear music. It’s not so much the narrow limitations of AI that are problematic, it’s our inescapable attraction to story. Jan 31, 2020 
Why is Slower Faster? Because working quickly makes you spend a ton of energy scratching at the surface, never uncovering the few deep realizations needed to repeatedly turn raw input into incredible output. The usable pieces are deep. You will not find mastery on the surface. Jan 30, 2020

However, stating that techniques like MDA do not rely on strong assumptions is an overstatement. Knowing that a variable plays a role is not the same as knowing what role. The decision to be made in model interpretation is to keep/remove. Much more cmplx than knwng it plys a role Jan 30, 2020

@Heinonmatti you have things to point to (averages, variances, etc.) meaning you can do things like “significance” tests and other types of exceedingly convenient story telling. Many a career have been built on the overly-agreeable Gaussian. Jan 27, 2020 
@Heinonmatti Just because one can build a model doesn’t mean they should. No science is always better than bad science. Bad science spews false narratives, which is dangerous when dealing with topics that impact lives. Regression uses Gaussians, meaning you have moments, meaning... Jan 27, 2020 
@Heinonmatti the level of complexity seen in the problem. There is a “proxy distance” between the phenomenon and the measurement. The simpler the model, the less is being accounted for WRT the phenomenon. Jan 27, 2020

Jan 27, 2020 
@dwnhogendoorn 1. Define *unreflected* starting point. 2. How do you read starting from logic as starting from emotion? Jan 27, 2020 
Emotion is highly effective as a “lubricant of reason” but there needs to be something to lubricate. Jumping immediately into angry statements backed by nothing only garners support from the cognitively lazy. You still have to start from reason to go beyond its limitations. Jan 27, 2020 
@normonics @dvmc9 All the best Norman. Hope you find answers to whatever angers you. Try logic. It helps. Jan 27, 2020 
@normonics @dvmc9 Again, nothing actually said. Nothing argued. Nothing pointed out. You are the literal definition of hand-waving. Thanks for the block. Should have came sooner. Jan 27, 2020

There are only so many distinct concepts. This is why going deep into any one field can uncover universal truths that span seemingly distinct domains. https://t.co/ciJQQ2iKmb https://t.co/EzptlxaqDZ Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs universal flexibility. You don’t need infinite material. You can mix and match your incomplete self again and again taking on any shape. People mistake computation as being limited because they only see the lump of clay. They don’t see how it behaves to become more. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs If a ball of clay could never fold-in on itself how many shapes could you make? Not many. I’m using a physical analogy but the fundamentals are the same. If you want to model reality to the extreme you have to *become* the pattern you wish to emulate. Folding-in is what leads to Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs When symbols can “eat themselves” via recursion they take-on a massive amount of flexibility because now those symbols can mix and match in countless ways. They can represent rich, fluid, complex patterns. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs If you take symbols and use them to represent (model) some aspect of nature you can only go so far. Good for science, but limited computationally. But if you allow those symbols to fold-in on themselves you are no longer restricted to what the naked symbols can represent. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs And I’m not arguing this is necessarily the same phenomenon, merely that nature already produces much of what we see by converting mechanical inputs into rich fluid outputs. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs And keep in mind, much of the phenomena we observe are emergent, being more than the sum of their parts. We have never been able to make logical chains of causality between inputs and outputs in truly complex systems. Funny how people seem to get complexity but miss computation. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs Those wanting to talk about the limits of computation have to start from its flexibility, not from its rigid arithmetic rules. That’s the point. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs This is the deepest aspect people struggle with. You really have to spend time understanding what it is Gödel did with meta-mathematics. It’s ingenious and immensely profound. I explain in my article, but I highly recommend you read Hofstadter and Chaitin. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs The fact that math is incomplete means it has “room” to speak about itself. Add recursion and you have a mechanism of massive, creative, flexibility to universality mirror any pattern. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs This is at the heart of Gödel’s argument (and Turing who based his work largely off Gödel). This is the “plastic” creative aspect of math and computation. THIS is the MOST critical aspect for one to understand universality. It come from the “openness” of incomplete formalisms. Jan 27, 2020 
@chasechandler @trishankkarthik @ashleshs Yes, and I need to reread it. It’s been a while. This is where I first came across the phrase “fabric of cognition” in relation to analogy. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs You’re definitely not “thick in the head” ... you are one of the few capable of having a fruitful conversation. THIS is what it’s all about. Neither of us *know* the ultimate answer. Bit it’s back-and-forth like this that gets us closer. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs The current *implementation* of computing fails trading (and many other things), yes. But this isn’t the same as saying computation fundamentally fails at these things (although it might, we don’t know). A phenomenon’s current implementation is not its definition. Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs But again, this requires we understand computing as not being limited by the mechanical constructs that makeup its operations. If human cognition is something more than computation then what? Maybe it is, but what is *it* and more to the point, why must it be more than comp? Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs ...that suggests this ability is not computational in nature. Computation, as we understand it, shows massive representational power (ability to simulate patterns). Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs What do you mean by “explain” human consciousness? If you mean in the reductionist sense then no we can’t, and I obviously agree with that (my prev article). But we do observe the human capacity to work with/recreate patterns. There is nothing in computation (that we know of) Jan 27, 2020 
In other words, it’s perfectly fine to believe human cognition is something more than “machine” but you have to start your argument with an understanding of what a machine is capable of. If you artificially stymie the definition of machine then your argument is based off fls prms https://t.co/V21hSGkWmJ Jan 27, 2020 
@SocialWealth @mdvex @normonics @trishankkarthik @ashleshs It’s about the representational power that seemingly mechanical formalisms are able to take on. This is at the heart of universality. The point is people don’t like the machine analogy because they are thinking of machines from a purely mechanical standpoint. This is far too lmtd Jan 27, 2020

@paulportesi @iwangulenko The light? The squinting? Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti Take home message is, look at the criteria for the Gauss-Markov theorem. How realistic do you think these are when sampling from reality? When ur tails get pudgy shit don’t converge fast if ever, moments vanish, and the idea that we can account for enough vars is ridiculous. Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog See Taleb's Tech Incerto (pg 15, 17...although latest version may have diff pages). Even going back to 1971 via Blattberg and Sargent https://t.co/RmcKuJfXDB https://t.co/S5QlHG8VvQ Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog Right, he's saying Linear least-square regression doesn’t work with fat tails, because the Gauss-Markov theorem (used to justify the approach) requires a thin-tailed distribution. Under fat tails many different regression lines can be fit to the same story. Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 12/12 I created a tree to help. https://t.co/miKY2LWEGP As for why it needs to hold, see the proofs in Ben Lambert's videos, includes in the tree. https://t.co/4B8G3HUETV Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 11/12 Upward and downward bias are expected. If we omit an important variable, the variable we DO use will take credit for the work of some omitted variable. Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 10/12 Obviously there are a number of ways, practically, that the 3rd GM assumption can be violated. The most common way is via Omitted Variable Bias, which results from estimating with an incorrectly specified model. Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 9/12 The significance of the 3rd GM assumption is that if it's no longer upheld it means least squares estimators are biased (the expectation of our estimator does not equal the population parameter). Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 8/12 The sixth GM assumption relates to No Serial Correlation. This means the covariance between 2 errors must be equal to 0 (unless we are considering the covariance of an error with itself). In other words, the errors have to be independent of each other. Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 7/12 The fifth GM assumption is related to Homoskedastic Errors. The distribution of errors away from the regression line stay relatively constant. In other words, variance does not vary systematically with x. Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 6/12 The fourth GM assumption is that there is no perfect collinearity among regressors. In other words, if by knowing one variable we know exactly some other variable then both of these cannot be included in the regression. Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 5/12 The third GM assumption (most important) is that the expectation of our error term in our population is going to be equal to 0. In other words, there is a "zero conditional mean of error." Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 4/12 The second GM assumption is that we have a set of sample data, which are a random sample from the population (each individual within the population is equally likely to be picked). It also means all of our data points come from the same population (and process). Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 3/12 These are the conditions: The first GM assumption has to do with the population process. It says that our population process has to be linear in parameters. Note that this does NOT mean we cannot have a VARIABLE in our model that is nonlinear. Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 2/12 Think of it as a benchmark for using OLS (since conditions unlikely to be met). They show what ideal conditions would be. A guide. It guarantees not just the best estimates that OLS can produce, but the best estimates that any linear model estimator can produce. Jan 26, 2020 
@Heinonmatti @AlxEtz @to_your_point @newapolloblog 1/12 The Gauss Markov theorem just says that if a certain set of assumptions are met then an OLS estimate for regression coefficients gives you BLUE (best linear unbiased estimator). It's "justifies" the idea that a good estimate of params can be made using weak assumptions. Jan 26, 2020

Decadence has forced us to artificially recreate what nature gave us for free. https://t.co/AT7iNFsxLa Jan 23, 2020 
Exercise is important. But there’s something sad about forcing yourself to simulate stress using fashioned weights at a gym. Zoos recreate environments by providing behavioral opportunities. That’s your gym. A sterile room designed with “behavioral opportunities.” Sad. Jan 23, 2020 
Be wary of calm perspectives. They are usually borrowed, by people who haven't lived the life necessary to warrant their point of view. Spending your life perched on a remote mountain calmly contemplating existence only means something if you climbed the mountain. https://t.co/ybqIFJaXSA Jan 23, 2020 
When you overhear people at the coffee shop spending their entire conversation complaining about people, you can be fairly certain they are accomplishing nothing with their lives. Jan 23, 2020

@lucklepper @RubenGao @GuidoGTH This is even true of fiction. The best fiction is not dreamed out of thin air. It holds allegory to real-life experiences of the author. You cannot coax nature’s secrets away from her without attempting to create something that survives. Jan 21, 2020 
@lucklepper @RubenGao @GuidoGTH 6/6 There are deep, ineffable truths that exist inside our attempts to construct something against the chaos of nature. and... Jan 21, 2020 
@lucklepper @RubenGao @GuidoGTH 5/6 You might argue that others have experienced the real thing, and you are merely combining their experiences into some new written solution. But borrowed wisdom does not count as understanding. Jan 21, 2020 
@lucklepper @RubenGao @GuidoGTH 4/6 That’s the enormous and unparalleled difference that building something brings. Writing done in the absence of genuine experience lacks the environmental stressors required to impart deep, relevant knowledge about a domain. Jan 21, 2020 
@lucklepper @RubenGao @GuidoGTH 3/6 But that cannot compare to attempting to *implement* an actual solution. Only in the attempt to construct something *real* can the environment inform us of what does and doesn’t work. Jan 21, 2020

7/7 Companies should be hiring true builders, not a collection of dumb cogs. Instead, they almost always pay for needless communication overhead, vision-engineering separation, and boring products. Stop paying for ants. Jan 21, 2020 
6/7 Software is informational, thus its scalability does not depend on a large number of people. Build one copy, replicate a million. Thus the division of labor in software is a flawed notion. It’s a remnant of industrial revolution thinking. Jan 21, 2020 
5/7 The communication overhead falls away to immediate action-response dynamics. Extremely high levels of tinkering, feedback, and adjustment not possible by large groups. Jan 21, 2020

@JoshStack @normonics You don’t need to start with best practices to see their value. Jan 21, 2020 
@JoshStack @normonics Indeed, but the point is this; how much should be replicated and how much should be truly creative should be fully dictated by the environment, not some upfront dedication to practices. The worth of upfront practices/knowledge is defined by the environment. Jan 21, 2020

Most software developers don’t *build*, they are hired to bring known practices to a specific part of the application. Ask a developer to piece together a full application themselves, most can’t. Ask a ... Jan 21, 2020 
@JoshStack @normonics If you’re doing mere replication (buildings, bridges, office towers) then prerequisite knowledge is obviously used, but if you’re going to truly understand discoveries made by others you should have attempted the build yourself, naively. Jan 21, 2020 
@normonics Already covered. The only learning necessary for building is whatever comes out as a byproduct of building. Building has no prerequisites. Jan 21, 2020 
@NuhaAlhaidary You are supposed to make mistakes. There is absolutely no prerequisite required. Building the wrong thing in the “wrong” way holds much more informational value than replicating some recipe on the “right” way to do it. Starting from foundations means you are leaning out of cntxt. Jan 21, 2020

Expressions ranked by value; "I enjoy learning" (meaningless, unless you're 5) "I read to learn" (low value) "I write to learn" (low-medium value) "I build to learn" (enormous) If you don't build, you'll never compare to someone who sits above the inflection point. https://t.co/lqNaNkNs3X Jan 20, 2020 
Most companies: - over-engineer projects; - hire “rockstars”; - name-drop clients; - use overly-pretty slide decks; - talk sales more than products; - run on over-consensus; - do more meeting than building. Start your comp. There’s nowhere near as much competition as you think. Jan 20, 2020

@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn Determinism relies on a connected thread of cause-and-effect between inputs and outputs. The opacity of complex systems precludes knowledge of this thread (not existence, but knowledge). Thus universal capacity cannot comment on determinism. That’s purely philosophical. Jan 15, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn I’m not saying this (and it would be type of inputs, not “amount of inputs”). Having the *capacity* to compute the same thing isn’t the same as computing the same thing. Anything that passes the GT complx thshd can in principle compute the same thing. This isn’t determinism. Jan 15, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn Something can be deterministic but have such a large “possibility space” that no 2 outcomes are the same (exceedingly low probability that 2 outcomes will be the same). Keep in mind chaotic systems are technically determ. but are unpredictable past very short horizons. Jan 15, 2020

@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn People’s analogies are possible via their unique history. Jan 15, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn Computation is computation, just as information is information. The only differentiating trait is what one can bring to the universal ability to compute. The only thing differentiating thus must be history-dependent. Hence analogizing. Jan 15, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn No. Both (all) human minds can yield the same statements. Both (all) human minds cannot strictly solve nontrivial problems. The properties of a problem are agnostic to the substrate attempting to compute its solution. Jan 15, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn If you are using "described" in terms of some fundamental proof then yes. It doesn't matter if it's someone's mind, a machine, or a hurricane. Computing is limited in strict proofs but not in representational power. Keep in mind, we don't use proofs to govern our lives. Jan 15, 2020

@joe_shipman @trishankkarthik Schools definitely fail at this. The system is built around the notion that students can be measured against sterile metrics. If schools must exist they should be based around what people can *create* regardless how they made it. Jan 14, 2020 
@dwnhogendoorn @trishankkarthik @ashleshs Also, people’s “difficulties” are unlikely to be used to compare people by intelligence. Jan 14, 2020 
@dwnhogendoorn @trishankkarthik @ashleshs However when I discuss people’s unique histories, this is a type of subjectivity with which problems are resolved. Thus I believe it’s still included. Jan 14, 2020 
@dwnhogendoorn @trishankkarthik @ashleshs assumed to be converted into decision problems. Since I am looking at “machine thinking” to compare human cognition I had to focus on how problem solving is modeled in computing machines. Thus no subjectivity. Jan 14, 2020 
@dwnhogendoorn @trishankkarthik @ashleshs Yes, I considered the subjective aspect of problems as well during the time I was writing this. But in computation, problems are only modeled as precise, yes/no decision problems.”Soft” answers are also allowed (optimization) but this isn’t the same as subjectivity. They are ... Jan 14, 2020 
@ToKTeacher @trishankkarthik You cannot bake a conclusion into your premise, otherwise your writing is circular. If you want to write objectively you have to step back and assume all views are equally possible. This is why computing “analogy” is used in relating computation to cognition. Jan 14, 2020 
@ToKTeacher @trishankkarthik That’s why I said “quotes on purpose” https://t.co/GymQOgjv4z Jan 14, 2020 
Great example. People need to embrace the mess, the downtime, the things that look nothing like the problem, in order to enable the solution to take form. Simple problems resolve upon close inspection, but the nontrivial often unfolds from a distance. https://t.co/gOPLwlpAVL Jan 14, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn No problem. I think these discussions are good for everyone. Jan 14, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn 4/4 We also don't have any model of computation more powerful. Sure, the physical makeup of a brain looks nothing like a Turing machine but it's not about the substrate, it's about symbol manipulation leading to representational universality. Jan 14, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn 3/4 If you agree the computing analogy of human cognition is valid then it *is* like a TM in that it can compute any pattern (TMs can simulate themselves, or any other TM). Jan 14, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn 2/4 Obviously the human brain is limited in space and time, as is anything in the universe, so for something physical to be analogous to an abstract model of computation we must ignore such infinities. Jan 14, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn 1/4 A Turing machine is a *theoretical* machine that computes a function. Nothing physical has unlimited "tape and time" so in that sense no, but I don't think that's a good argument for the brain not being a "TM". Jan 14, 2020 
@UntergrundmannG Indeed. I like his term “concept network.” He talks about it in terms of people overall, but I believe this is key to understanding comparative intelligence. People can have different “concept networks” based on their history, which predisposes them to solve a given problem. Jan 14, 2020 
@famadeo @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn Thanks Francisco. Yes, with enough time (and the right exposure/experience) anyone should be able to arrive at a solution. Whether the solutions look the same between people would depend on their respective experiences. Thus their “reasoning” could look different. Jan 14, 2020 
13/13 - thus the computing analogy is a valid way to reason about how people solve problems, and explain how the perceived difference in ”smartness” between individuals relates to the universal capacity to make better analogies based off one’s history. Jan 14, 2020 
12/13 - we know cultural upbringing influences IQ, and domain experience/job familiarity dramatically impacts performance; Jan 14, 2020 
11/13 - those with more relevant experienced patterns are able to draw better connections to the problem of interest, narrow its search space, and arrive at a good solution; Jan 14, 2020

9/13 - this is what makes “universal machines”, all capable of computing the same thing; - under the computing analogy this means *all* people are capable of making the same isomorphisms (analogies) that bind ones thinking to the problem they are trying to solve; Jan 14, 2020 
8/13 - - we also know from computation that once a computing device/language reaches a certain threshold of complexity it becomes self-referencing, and at that point it can simulate *any* pattern; Jan 14, 2020 
7/13 - I believe analogy is the way people narrow the search space that is too large to compute by brute force (computers narrow their search space via approximations); Jan 14, 2020 
6/13 - I argue that it means some people analogize better than others, not because of some inherent/biological difference, but because of their previous exposure to patterns similar to the problem being tackled; Jan 14, 2020 
5/13 - but what does it mean for someone to use a heuristic more effectively? Jan 14, 2020 
4/13 - routines are quickly solved and predictable, thus any difference between people solving shallow problems requiring a recipe is uninteresting. The real differentiator would be in the heuristics; Jan 14, 2020 
3/13 - thus if comparing people by intelligence you are really comparing how effective they are at using routines/heuristics; Jan 14, 2020 
2/13 - if the computing analogy is valid (as a model of human cognition) then we can look at how problems are solved in computing; - in computing, simple problems are resolved by routines, complex problems by heuristics; Jan 14, 2020 
TLDR 1/13 - “smarter” people are deemed more capable at solving problems; - thus the speed and quality of one’s solution is used to rank “smartness”; https://t.co/4wnpcybx4l Jan 14, 2020

@GuruAnaerobic @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn Also that we know computation is universal, and that the computing analogy used is valid given the extreme flexibility afforded systems with a rich enough symbolic repertoire (passes the Godel-Turing threshold). Jan 13, 2020 
@GuruAnaerobic @trishankkarthik @ashleshs @dwnhogendoorn I am saying the comparative intelligence between people is based on exposure to pre-existing patterns (towards end of article).

@MikeAnblips @nntaleb This is correct. Resources (notes, images, etc.) are added to nodes whenever the length exceeds the minimum.

5/5 inside your domain they're going to make you look like a novice. Your precise thinking cannot possibly compare to those who embrace the nonlinear, the complex, the messy, the driven. Drop the robot shit. Hit your work fast and hard when your mind tells you it's time. Jan 01, 2020 
4/5 If you follow some mechanical schedule you remove the stressors. You have nothing to adapt to, and your mind isn't in the game. Your work is as dry as the formula you used to be "productive." You'll impress some for a while, but the moment you meet someone passionate... Jan 01, 2020 
3/5 time to produce results. But that's because you're leaving out intensity. Nature works via bursts of intermittency, not mechanical, procedural steps. You will be motivated enough times to accumulate the work you need if you leverage your motivation in the moment. Jan 01, 2020 
2/5 News flash. You're not a robot, you're an emotional passionate flawed individual with intermittent enthusiasm. Your risk averse behavior isn't going to change millions of years of evolution. You think the unreliability of motivation prevents you from accumulating enough... Jan 01, 2020 
1/5 People see projects as linear, and hope to accumulate enough total time between now and the deadline to finish the project. They patholigize things like motivation/passion and instead promote dull, scheduled, robotic work. They don't believe motivation is enough. Jan 01, 2020

@yaneerbaryam @nntaleb Testing them doing what? Using the moments of a distribution you don’t actually have? Saying we “tested” something is meaningless.

@yaneerbaryam @nntaleb You’re saying “once we test the correlation sufficiently, we learn something about causation.” “Sufficiently” is what exactly?

9/10 But if that gap is artificially created by using measurements that fundamentally lack the capacity to probe the cause, they are not being scientific. Dec 18, 2019

7/10 Modern information cannot compete with that which emerged out of survival because the latter contains information imprinted directly from its environment. Dec 18, 2019 
6/10 There has and always will be an epistemic restriction that accompanies most real-world decision making. When we respect this restriction we are constrained to make better decisions with a superior source of information. Dec 18, 2019 
5/10 Ancient wisdom was/is sound because it was never really “wisdom.” The ancients were forced to embrace nature first-hand. Their entire existence was based on survival, not convenience. Their tools and approaches were not chosen, they emerged as things that *worked*. Dec 18, 2019 
4/10 Access to less information shifts the pursuit of “why” from the causal to the apparent. The reason goes no deeper than “because it survived.” That which adapts to the environment is correct. Dec 18, 2019 
3/10 But a consideration of the value of information must take into account what generated it. Information produced by our measurements is not the same as information produced through an object or idea’s endurance through time. Dec 18, 2019

4/5 Your agitation of one’s proposed idea is thus not only legitimate, it’s fully within your capabilities. The way you challenge theory without speaking its language is by focusing on what it cannot explain, not what it purports to explain. Dec 09, 2019 
3/5 This means theory exists in a constant state of susceptibility to counter evidence, and that countering does not require familiarity with the language used to defend a model. Dec 09, 2019 
2/5 2 important points to understand: 1) The power of refutation lies in epistemic asymmetry; it requires far less information to refute a theory than to support it. 2) All attempts to assess a model’s validity must remain agnostic to the tools used to build and promote it. Dec 09, 2019

@SPORTBETTINGMAN Complexity isn't more difficult, it's different. Completely different. There are an "infinite" number of histories that precede any complex observation, and no amount of reductionist bullshit is going to change that. Nov 23, 2019 
@SPORTBETTINGMAN The only way someone is going to provide reductionist-style measurements to the truly complex is by force-feeding simplistic narratives (gaussian/linear) down the throats of naive students and the uninitiated pubic. There is no getting around the opacity of the complex. Nov 23, 2019 
@SPORTBETTINGMAN The higher the complexity the softer the approach. The only "hard" concept that is agnostic to levels of complexity is information. This is why probability and information are the language to use. But they are not going to give you reductionist answers. Nov 23, 2019 
@SPORTBETTINGMAN For those looking to understand human behavior they should be using methods commensurate with complexity. Models that are nonparametric, that are known to predict complex systems (far from perfect, but at least the narrative isn't being forced). Nov 23, 2019 
@SPORTBETTINGMAN Searching for an explicit measure is reductionist. You are looking at intelligence through the reductionist lens, searching for some well-defined, singular measure. It isn't going to happen. The proxy distance is far too high (the highest). Nov 23, 2019 
@SPORTBETTINGMAN It isn't. Why do you think it needs to be measured? Universality doesn't require intelligence to be quantified. We know complex systems/computation can arrive at outputs in multiple ways. HI is the most complex phenomenon we know of. Nov 23, 2019 
@SPORTBETTINGMAN Your premise that passion/interest has something to do with intelligence is flawed. Nov 23, 2019 
@SPORTBETTINGMAN @normonics That’s the point. It’s not about something being measured. It’s about accepting what has always been. And it is the absolute opposite of reductionism. Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac There is a lot of simplistic storytelling that gets labelled as science. When someone (including "real" scientists) rest their arguments on simple trends for complex phenomena assume they are focused more on their career than the pursuit of truth. Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac But that story becomes BS the moment an extreme event happens. Nature will eventually show you its tail, and when it does, your model needs to be ready. Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac What you have to understand is that we can always spot a trend when looking at a sample of data. Small samples of reality will always produce slivers of linearity. You can fit a model to those slivers and paint a nice story about how nature works. Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac These events are randomly distributed over time (technically speaking, a homogeneous Poisson process). The time period between extreme events is unpredictable. Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac You are saying each event we observe is declining for a "reason", otherwise it would be random. But conflicts of humanity do not share the same set of causes. Data pertaining to human violence has no temporal structure. Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac Looking at the difference between yesterday's and today's frequencies alone is one thing, but interpreting that trend as something predictive is another story altogether. To suggest we are getting more peaceful means you are assuming violent events are not independent. Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac But when dealing with non-trivial distributions (extreme events) the averages become unwieldy, and harder to "locate". It is easier to grow your career using Gaussians than to take the time to learn probability and build complex models. Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac Because with simple distributions it is easy to calculate the average, and with an average in-hand you get to tell a story (publish papers, be invited to speak to the media, etc.). Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac When social scientists use "predictive" tools to make broad claims they use techniques that do not account for extreme events (i.e. they use Gaussian distributions). Why? Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac Since these distributions deal with rare events they are prone to sampling error, meaning when you grab some data those data can easily tell you the wrong story (easy to "not see" the tail). Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac Wars are extreme events and as such casualties are expected to exhibit heavy-tailed distributions (power law decay). This just means in these situations things happen rarely, but when they do, they pack a punch. Nov 23, 2019 
@davidsarac Some nice journalism here. Paint a compelling story using past frequencies, call it science, and the masses fall in line. I don't blame the reader, but I do blame pseudoscientists peddling nonsense. For the reader's sake, here is how it really works. Nov 23, 2019 
@Descartes_Ghost @normonics The point is universality is consequence of the limitations of a language. The limitations of a language are not what stymie the ability to compute, they are precisely what gives them license. Stay on topic. Nov 23, 2019 
@Descartes_Ghost @normonics He showed the limitations of any language that can "talk about itself" ...more fundamentally, he showed the infinite flexibility afforded systems that have this limitation. If math were complete it would lose its plasticity. It is the limits of language that set it free. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics What am I claiming beyond this? - there are obsrvd dffrncs (outputs) between people; - diffrnt outputs can be arrived at without changing inputs/experience/history (and vice versa) in complex systems - human "intelligence" is a complex phenom - human "intelligence" is universal Nov 23, 2019 
@Descartes_Ghost @normonics Answer this question: Why is Gödel not considered a hypocrite? He used math to show math has limitations. Talking from inside the system and outside the system are 2 very different things. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics This seems like a different argument than precluding universality. The source of computation is irrelevant if the computation itself is the same. That is the only claim of universality. The source of such universal computation is where science ends, and phspy and/or rgn begin. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics Yes, run any algorithm, replicate any pattern, execute any function, arrive at any output, simulate any environment. So what is your argument? Some can run algos others can't? Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics Now we are talking about 2 different algos. The one humans use and the one we are trying to replicate/compute. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics And by "data" I mean history, experience, possibly opportunity, etc. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics People don't have better algos, they have better data. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics Running 1 algo IS universality. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics If we settle on these definitions: - algorithm (as used in nature) - inputs/outputs - history/experience - stressors/adaptation Then I suspect we may actually agree. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics You only need one algorithm. The algorithm is not dictating the outputs beyond what is produced by everyone. It is the inputs that are dictating the outputs. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics We are in agreement here. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics Yes agreed, but if the algorithm doesn't change that's the same as history only. Thus to argue against universality is to suggest the algo changes. How does it change? When/where does it change? Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics Right, agreed. So if you freeze the algorithm then it's only history that dictates observed differences. Ergo, universality. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics This is the main argument to universality (or should/will be) since it shows that algos don't need to change, that environment/history dictates outputs, and that observed differences are history-dependent. What part do you disagree with? Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics I don't see why discovery of new algorithms is required. That is something humans do because our models are mere residuals to what nature does. Universality = one algo (or set) Ago = produces diff outputs based on inputs Observed differences: not algo dependent (history dep) Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics This is why "algorithm" must be defined the way it works in complex systems. They do not produce the same outputs because their exposure to inputs are constantly changing. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics Those differences do not suggest a better algorithm, they suggest one algorithm merely arrived at a better solution. Those are not the same thing. If one has better data/experience/ etc. then 2 identical algorithms will produce different results. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics But it's not the individual organism that survives, it's the species. The internal rule set is just there to allow for reproduction, so that enough organisms can participate in the "game". Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics Yes, there must be some "algorithm" to "go about" trying to arrive at solutions in a machine. If we agree on this point then the question is do humans leverage "algorithms" in this sense as well. Yes. We use heuristics all the time. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics Nature is the "algorithm" ... external stressors force systems to adapt or die. It does not require internal instructions on how to go about surviving (DNA does not instruct adaptation). Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics If we use algorithms to build complex models off data, rather than explicitly instructing the machine what to do, then the "algorithm" is not dictating behavior. Behavior begins to emerge in ways that cannot be traced back. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics But you are using "algorithm" in a restricted sense. In the traditional computing sense. Simple programs follow explicit instructions and produce exact outputs. But that is not the only thing algorithms can do. They can "arrive" at completely unforeseen outputs. They can "adapt. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics So you're saying behavior must come from something more than an object. Why? Nov 23, 2019 
@Descartes_Ghost Right, but we are blind to the silent history of how people got those skills. We don't have access to a complex system's history. What you are observing can be arrived at in various ways Analogy: different materials with different chemistries can arrive at the same temperature. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics Is the human brain not a vessel? Why do you think intelligence must extend beyond the vessel? It definitely depends on more than the vessel, since the vessel must adapt to external stressors. That's computation. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics " the vessel by itself is not intelligence" isn't an argument. Back it up. What are your premises? Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics @Mengsen You're not making arguments. I recall addressing @Mengsen. Provide a bullet point list of your arguments and I'll address. I have no interest in emotional responses or borrowed wisdom. Wastes everyone's time. Nov 23, 2019 
@Cattywumpus Indeed, but keep in mind that motivation needs to be allowed to emerge by a system that recognizes true talent when it sees it. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics Just because a machine hasn't shown you the richness you experience on a personal level doesn't mean universality cannot capture it. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics That is not a mix up. Strange loops is where we get the ability of TMs from. Universality allows every "function" to be computable/simulated due to a language'a self-referencing ability. If you take away the self-referencing you lose the flexibility that drives universality. Nov 23, 2019 
@Descartes_Ghost But where do the differences arise from? That's the point. Of course people have external differences. We all have different experiences. Universality argues against the notion that these differences are innate. Nov 23, 2019 
@MarketAphorist @normonics If you were genuinely interested in pursuing truth you would look into the "word salad" and realize it's called science. Instead you slap a label on it. Walk away. Nov 23, 2019 
@Descartes_Ghost Look at complex systems, multiple realizability, the science of information, Gödel, Turing, computation, etc. Understand emergence and proxy distance. There is far more science to universality than to the idea people can be ranked by simplistic measures. Nov 23, 2019 
@Descartes_Ghost Change the terrain and who is deemed 'intelligent" changes. Nov 23, 2019 
@Descartes_Ghost Chess ranking is based on pattern recognition. Math "production" is but one type of "intelligence", and also based on one's exposure to previous challenges, how it was taught to them, etc. These do not (cannot) mean someone is more intelligent. Nov 23, 2019 
@normonics No. There are different levels of complexity across organisms. Universality comes from the computing machinery necessary to process self-referencing language. Nov 23, 2019 
@Descartes_Ghost Nothing you said has any basis in “measuring” intelligence. People can choose to track and quantify anything they like, that’s not science. Science is showing a demonstrable connection between what you measure and the phenomenon of interest. Nov 23, 2019 
@Descartes_Ghost “Feeling the difference” isn’t science. We don’t call those experiments. Talking to someone with more experience (exposure to patterns being tested) isn’t a gauge on intelligence. Nov 23, 2019 
Tell people everyone has the same intelligence and their rebuttals will stem from: 1) the loss of their entitled station in life as a “smart person”, or, 2) the loss of their primary excuse for not achieving what others do. There are no sound arguments based on insecurity. Nov 23, 2019

@trishankkarthik Speed is just familiarity. A disparity in speed between people is based off exposure to pre-existing patterns. Nov 22, 2019 
@yaneerbaryam The degree of substrate dependence on high-level information processing is speculative at best. Finally, identifying local agency to complex phenomena is highly platonic. Nov 21, 2019 
@yaneerbaryam For substructures to preclude universality there would have to exist measurable differences between individuals with respect to physical subdivisions in the brain. Even if this was “shown”, this assumes those subdivisions must be physical rather than informational in nature. Nov 21, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam What do you mean AI is a universal architecture? We search for appropriate architectures, for narrowly defined tasks. I would see HI as more universal since our attempts at architecting AI networks are mere residuals to what humans already possess. Nov 21, 2019 
Consensus lends credence to nothing. Science works when it is challenged, not when it is accepted. Those who blindly trust unanimity are not being “scientific.” It is the system of science that works, not people’s collective devotion to the incumbent narrative. #science Nov 20, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb I'd be delighted/honored. Let me know how you like to collaborate on written work (repo, email, carrier pigeons) and I'll contribute accordingly. Important stuff. Nov 20, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb The only real delta between people is their level of ignorance. Assuming others are more intelligent is a way to side-step the work required to understand complexity and computation. It's a lazy argument with no basis. Nov 19, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb There is no solving complex problems by "understanding" the situation. Nobody has access to the information some assume "smart" people have access to, so better machinery wouldn't help anyway. Nov 19, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb As I argue, it all comes down to the complexity of the problem being worked on. P vs NP is just a reflection of the fundamental opacity inherent to complex systems/situations. Nov 19, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb This means solving problems is about doing and observing. Everyone can operate at the meta level. Everyone can *do* their way to the same solution. Some will get there via luck/opportunity; nothing to do with a delta between people's internal machinery. Nov 19, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb But this doesn't move against universality, since employing metaheuristics means making very few assumptions about the actual problem being solved. Nov 19, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb This is why people (and any other machine) don't solve complex problems explicitly, they employ metaheuristics. Could someone "smarter" be better at using metaheuristics? Could they be reducing the set of candidate solutions to a manageable size, better than someone else? Sure. Nov 19, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb Which leaves us asking whether some people can use deterministic computation better than others. Take brute force. We know the cost is proportional to the number of candidate solutions, exploding combinatorially. Nov 19, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb As such, we see no evidence for some biological specimens having access to exponentially better computation that others do not. I've never met anyone that appears exponentially smarter than me. Nov 19, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @ashleshs @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb I agree that the statement "some people are exponentially smarter than others" is meaningless. The delta between "smart" and so-called "not smart" is not even close to the deltas expected between DTM vs NTM. Nov 19, 2019

@MarkMulvey Sure. None of that goes against what I’ve said. The observation still stands. Nov 14, 2019 
@wordsbywilliam2 Sure, but creating something new needs more than finding value. It's not inspiration if what you make never extends beyond replication. Nov 14, 2019 
@MarkMulvey I think it will. It's not the same criticism that occurred in prvs gnrtns. Prvs gnrtns didn't point to replication they suggested music was "garbage." If you looked at the deltas between music patterns across decades, I bet the last 10 years would show the smallest delta. Nov 14, 2019 
I get that each generation has music the foregoing generation generally despises. But when I was younger the older generation could still recognize our music as original. Today, popular music sounds entirely replicated, lacking fresh synthesis. I don’t hear anything new. Nov 14, 2019

@rdntola @Heinonmatti @JoshHochschild You are not making an argument. You are appealing to authority, and construing the message to fit your attachment to divine narrative. Sorry buddy, but sophistry gets blocked. Go learn logic and understand how science works before attempting to debate. Nov 11, 2019 
@normonics @PresentWitness_ @rdntola @Heinonmatti @JoshHochschild Now I'm wishing I said that originally. Nov 11, 2019 
@rdntola @Heinonmatti @JoshHochschild Complex problems are solved with approximations and heuristics. They always have been. The "faith" one uses to march forward is the use of counterfactuals. But in science that "faith" must be destroyed repeatedly. We do not (cannot) anchor progress on an undying belief. Nov 11, 2019 
@rdntola @Heinonmatti @JoshHochschild If this is an argument for filling the gaps of inductive validity with the divine then it's a straw man. Complexity isn't about trying to achieve complete information. Complexity has *fundamental* opacity. Arriving at a clean narrative is not the purpose of complexity. Nov 11, 2019

@rdntola @Heinonmatti @JoshHochschild Mysticism is the spiritual perception of knowledge believed to be inaccessible to the intellect. Complexity is not about appealing to something wholly inaccessible, it is about not relying in simplistic narratives to provide agency. Nov 11, 2019 
@rdntola @Heinonmatti @JoshHochschild Take a look at today's institutions and state of statistical education. What do you mean it's been tried? People haven't arrive at a nice narrative around complexity? Complexity doesn't provide convenient narratives, that's the point. Nov 11, 2019 
@rdntola @Heinonmatti @JoshHochschild That only silence can help with complexity? You've said nothing, but I guess that was your point. Nothing doesn't make for an argument. It also makes no sense to say "it's been tried" as though you have access to when a revolution might occur. Nov 11, 2019

Natural work comes from something welling up inside of you, in the moment. It’s a kind of pure realization imploring you to be the vehicle of its expression. Nov 08, 2019 
You cannot chase something that leaves no trail. You cannot connect someone else’s dots to make a picture of your own life. There Are No Recipes. Nov 07, 2019 
There is no locating nature’s ultimate answer. There is only appreciating what emerges and leveraging discovery in the moment. You are a creature of adaptation, not prediction. You cannot schedule your creativity, it must be compelled. Nov 07, 2019 
Limit your hero worship only to the initial motivation it brings you. The so-called paths and approaches championed by those you revere are just post-hoc explanations, conceived to fill-in the gaps of a wholly unexplainable and unexpected windfall. Nov 07, 2019 
You have been conditioned into thinking success flows from known fundamentals, despite nature showing us it emerges entirely from unforeseeable circumstances. You cannot see that your best self materializes out of friction, not sterile reassurance. Nov 07, 2019 
You are sidelined by complexity because you have never been taught to embrace variation. Your schools have modeled you into a creature of convention, taught to shun failure, avoid risk, and perceive human engagement as competition rather than collaboration. Nov 07, 2019 
That feeling you get after purchasing the latest book from the business section is just the recycled high that accompanies the illusion convenient narratives provide. An endless attempt at grasping the mirage of an unworkable blueprint. Nov 07, 2019 
Your luminaries are statistical aberrations, with stories no more interesting or unique than those who have failed. You are reading but one of countless plausible narratives in an ocean of silent evidence. Nov 07, 2019

@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb Thus a gambler should try to maximize the expected value of the logarithm of his capital in order to remain additive in repeated bets. Apologies for the Tweet storm. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb And therein lies the trick first used by Boltzmann, then Kelly, then some smart economists. Kelly showed that it's the logarithm of the gambler's capital which is additive in sequential bets, and to which the law of large numbers applies. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb Boltzmann used the logarithm to connect entropy to the number of configurations because he knew the logarithm can turn multiplicative quantities into additive ones. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb We know entropy is an additive quantity, like mass and energy (combine 2 volumes of gas get twice the mass). But the "number of ways" we combine things is multiplicative (2 dice can fall in 36 ways). Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb In this fashion Boltzmann showed that entropy depends on the information one happens to have available. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb We can be more obvious about the connection between entropy and Kelly betting by expressing uncertainty in terms of its original mechanical model. The more possible configurations of a system the less we know, the higher the entropy. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb MI can thus measure the gambler's ignorance and this is how entropy connects to the "side information/edge" the gambler uses to make money. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb Since MI is a way to measure how our knowledge of the proxy reduces the uncertainty around the true outcome, MI is a measure of uncertainty. So is entropy. The connection between entropy and MI is well established. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb The edge is some incomplete piece of information. Assessing how valuable that incomplete information is can be done through the use of mutual information (MI), since MI quantifies the amount of information we can get about one variable (outcome) by observing another (edge). Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb So where does entropy come in? If we are framing one's growth of wealth in terms of a noisy channel then we are dealing with uncertainty (imperfect information). The gambler's "edge" can be seen as a proxy to the actual betting outcome. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb This is the second line on Taleb's board. So we can see Kelly expressed the rate of transmission over a noisy communication channel in terms of various probabilities (as Shannon did) but applied to one's wealth when betting. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb and rearranging: https://t.co/3V0tOsO469 Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb This (3) is the expected value for log wealth. So, what happens when we maximize the gambler's growth of capital? By differentiating equation 3 and setting to 0: https://t.co/BLkEgvYtQB Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb Notice how we have extended equation 1 by taking into account the probability of error, the probability of correct communication, and the fraction of the bet. This is the first line on Taleb's whiteboard, but with different symbols: https://t.co/KNVENuDBoz Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb ...going broke (absorbing barrier). So the alternative is for the gambler to bet a fraction of his capital each time. Now we can express the growth of the gambler's capital as: https://t.co/SSacg7RSBV Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb But in real life the "channel" is going to be noisy, which means uncertainty, which means taking into account the probability of error and correct transmission, (p and q). Since we now have imperfect information we can say that continued betting will eventually lead to ... Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb In this scenario we have an obvious exponential growth of money after N bets: https://t.co/GIdGQkM8aM Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb If the channel is noiseless then there is no uncertainty. This means the amount of money a gambler can make depends only on how much he chooses to bet. With no uncertainty the gambler would obviously choose to bet all his money. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb The distinguishing feature of a communication system is that the ultimate receiver (person) is in a position to profit from knowledge of the input. Thus Kelly showed that a gamblers money could grow exponentially using his side information ("edge"). Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb In this scenario we are assuming a gambler is receiving information about the outcomes of some chance event. This is the gambler's "edge." A gambler's edge is the side information he can use to gain an advantage (he knows something others do not). Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb Information theory is grounded in Shannon's communication channel analogy. This can in turn be framed WRT to betting by showing how a gambler's growth of capital is equal to the rate of transmission of information over the channel. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb Kelly betting is the application of information theory to investing. This conceptual leap makes sense since information theory tells us how to quantify information to make decisions under uncertainty. Nov 01, 2019 
@iwangulenko @birdxi1988 @nntaleb I'll give you some background first, then bring in entropy. Note I am not speaking for Taleb here. Nov 01, 2019

@HeartlandNarr8 The mathematical concepts themselves (numbers, sets, etc.) are abstractions to deeper constructs.

@spyrosmakrid @Sd_hector Nothing to do with you. Someone else on the thread. Oct 13, 2019 
@Sd_hector @spyrosmakrid Arrogance has no bearing on the validity or sounded of an argument. Causal opacity is a well-known property of complex systems, as is the failure of reductionism as complexity increases. You being offended is irrelevant. I block the ignorant and intellectually lazy. blocked Oct 13, 2019 
@Sd_hector @spyrosmakrid What’s not true? Obviously today’s AI cannot generate the false causality, hence the term AGI (not today’s). And no, iterating over false causalities cannot converge to true causality. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid True. Rather I don’t *believe* AGI will depend on us explicitly engineering causality into the system. However, the AGI will undoubtedly come up with causal explanations when asked to expound their actions, just as humans do. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid The majority of scientists don’t understand complexity. It makes them uncomfortable. They want the logical narratives that only simple systems can provide (easier to publish). So we must entertain these outdated ideas about how to go about solving complex problems. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid But the idea that intelligence will be engineered from the bottom up by piecing together well-understood constructs is just the failure of reductionism making itself apparent yet again. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid “Physics envy” is alive and well in the AI industry. Many deride anything that looks like alchemy as some unprincipled approach to crafting intelligent machines. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid There is no reason to believe AGI will depend on something that is fundamentally not available in natural complex systems. AI experts arguing for causal dependence is just another example of our traditional over-reliance on simple, convenient interpretations of phenomena. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid Thus placing AI in juxtaposition to human intelligence and drawing distinctions between them based on causality is a misleading comparison. We cannot argue AI requires causality when the human dependence on such a concept is largely imagined. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid This isn’t just science. Any human enterprise dealing with the reasonably complex is, by definition, opaque to causal interpretation. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid The idea that humanity comes up with upfront designs that get verified through empiricism makes for a good story (i.e. journal publications, media) but is largely fictitious. The reality is we get surprised and layer on a “causal” story post facto. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid This means our discoveries/inventions are a result of nature *revealing* her secrets to us after messily venturing into the unknown and getting surprised. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid With human progress, how much causality is true, versus a false narrative, is highly debatable. Any intellectually honest scientist admits our progress occurs via tinkering. Oct 13, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid Saying AI must understand the “why” is based off an assumption that when humans attach a reason to their observations they are providing a true casual explanation. This is a masssive assumption. Oct 12, 2019 
@spyrosmakrid Exactly. Causality is hardly a resolved issue in science, and there are *fundamental* limitations when we approach the complex. Providing a causal explanation is not the same as having a (true) causal explanation. Many causal “explanations” are convenient false narratives. Oct 12, 2019

@normonics This is all assuming I’ve understood your original statements. Oct 08, 2019 
@normonics So yes, the search for the universal is a search for the unconditional, but only in its application, not its makeup. In fact, a system’s restrictions/conditions are where its universality comes from. But those conditions are on the system itself, not the environment. Oct 08, 2019 
@normonics We can also look at universality from the standpoint of criticality (you mentioned temperature). Observed behavior of many different systems adheres to a set of universal laws at their fixed point. This universality is built-in, achieved by the fractal nature of the system itself Oct 08, 2019 
@normonics Thus I’m not sure I agree the systems in question (e.g. computing) must be condition-generating. The “unconditionality” of universality is built-in and arise by virtue of the environment. But the environment has nothing to do with the ability of the system to be universal. Oct 08, 2019 
@normonics You use homeostasis as an example of condition-generating system. But in homeostasis physical and chemical conditions are regulated *despite* changes in the environment. This is what allows for dynamic equilibria. As before, the capacity to self-regulate is built-in. Oct 08, 2019 
@normonics Survivability happens through imposed environmental stressors making complex systems thrive. Natural selection is a self-sufficient “algorithm” allowing adaptation in the presence of stress. The capacity of NS to permit adaptation doesn’t disappear when stress is removed. Oct 08, 2019 
@normonics But not being condition-generating is not the same as the environment being separated from any system’s realization. A system can be self-sufficient in its makeup, with no ability to generate conditions, and still be capable of say adapting, which depends on the environment. Oct 08, 2019 
@normonics If I understand correctly, you’re saying the assumed self-sufficiency of computing insulates it from any external conditional considerations. You take issue with this, as you’re saying complex systems are condition-generating, thus you cannot leave out the environment. Oct 08, 2019 
@normonics Can you elaborate on “the more complex the system, the more conditional are its behaviors.” ? Oct 08, 2019 
@normonics Indeed. https://t.co/MqSPkW4MIF https://t.co/yVnVOEOEWj Oct 08, 2019

@rafcann My tweet said “disqualify people from public discourse.” This means discussion/conversation occurring over time. There’s a massive (life-threatening) difference between being aware of an impending hurricane and actually having cases of water set aside and an escape plan. Sep 28, 2019 
@rafcann You’re using a false analogy. There’s obviously a difference between sounding an alarm and raising awareness. The latter is done in an effort to get people to change their behavior or act on their beliefs (not some one-time event). Sep 28, 2019 
@paulportesi There’s a difference between naive rules that stifle progress and high-level constraints that force systems to improve via variation and iteration. Sep 28, 2019 
@paulportesi Nature doesn’t tap into random variation and leave it at that. It has constraints that force systems to either survive or die out. Without “rules” there is nothing to adapt to. Sep 28, 2019 
@paulportesi If a rule imposes a restriction on progress then I would agree. But this “rule” does the opposite. It provides a qualifier for advancing discussions forward. It forces something to “survive” rather than spin endlessly in idle speculation. Sep 28, 2019 
@paulportesi Absolutely, progress occurs via tinkering. But keep in mind what tinkering is. You cannot tinker if you don’t make an attempt. Again, it’s not about having the “right” solution, it’s about putting something forward that can fail. No proposed solution means no iteration. Sep 28, 2019 
@Dee_Wrecks Great question. There’s an entire section on Forcing versus Finding the Narrative, which discusses methods appropriate for dealing with complexity. Also, the end of the article discusses: https://t.co/C5WBJjUhdX Sep 28, 2019 
@Dee_Wrecks And to be clear. Not offering a solution doesn’t mean you don’t have one. The point is to put potential solutions forward, however imperfect, to support healthy dialogue that improves over time. Sep 28, 2019 
@Dee_Wrecks It’s not possible to label something as BS unless you held in your mind some alternative. The real BS busters are those who present alternatives. Without an alternative where would the contrast between truth and BS originate? Sep 28, 2019 
@normonics Agreed. But if there is a genuine interest in working towards a solution then it presents a way forward. Raising awareness absent any talk on potential solutions is sterile. Solutions don’t have to be “right” but they should be put on the table for debate. Sep 28, 2019 
@UntergrundmannG 1) the harshness of a statement has nothing to do with its validity; 2) anyone asking questions is contributing towards a solution. The only way this would not be the case is if the asker didn’t acknowledge genuine answers not inline with their pre-existing views. Sep 28, 2019

@normonics @Mengsen Expression of a pattern is not limited to a language’s ability to encode. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics @Mengsen Suggesting a formalism is the only way to capture and express a pattern is simply not true. While a formalism cannot itself encode arbitrary patterns, this does not mean it cannot be used to achieve this goal. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics @Mengsen Low-level formalisms that self-reference lead to the mirroring of arbitrary patterns. We see it in the universality of software, in the modeling of nature, and in the evolution of species. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics @Mengsen It does this by iterating on originally bad approximations. Whether you’re parameter tuning or doing trial-and-error heuristics you are self-referencing on top of an approximation built by a formalism. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics @Mengsen Science does not build models by explicitly stating every possible aspect of a nontrivial system. Yet it “captures” the behavior of said system. How does it do this? Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics @Mengsen To understand the second point in the list you have to realize that explicit encoding is not the only mechanism of capture. Modeling is an abstraction that goes beyond what explicit encoding can provide. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics @Mengsen A language’s built-in limitations do not place limits on its ability to model reality. A model is not explicitly encoded. If there were an explicit encoding between your language and reality you would not be in possession of a model. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics @Mengsen The paradox that arises from self-referencing limits a language’s consistency and ability to prove. But consistency and proving have absolutely nothing to do with approximating patterns. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics @Mengsen The first point was shown by Godel wrt Russel’s PM. Godel proved it by stepping outside math (meta) to show the paradox that arises when a language talks about itself. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics @Mengsen Sorry for the delay, got caught up with something. There are 2 core things to understand here: 1) any formalism rich enough in its expressive power can self-reference; 2) a self-referencing language has the capacity to mirror/approximate/model arbitrary patterns. Sep 23, 2019 
@Mengsen @normonics It does not have to refer to anything outside itself, but it must refer TO itself to possess the capacity to replicate arbitrary patterns. Without self-referencing there is nothing beyond the formalism. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics Put it this way. If your alleged axiomatic mapping existed between formalism and reality (or some aspect of it) there would be no opacity in complex models. Show me the axioms of a complex model. You can’t. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics The model yes, not the axioms from which it is written. There is no mapping between a programming language used to create a neural network and the reality that neural network hopes to approximate. Models are arrived at, not explicitly programmed. Models and axioms are very dffrnt Sep 23, 2019 
@Mengsen @normonics Godel is all about self-reference. He showed that a formalism capable of “talking about itself” leads to contradictions. Same with Turing, but for machines capable of mechanizing said formalisms. This self-reference is where the ability to express beyond the formalism comes from. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics I’ll use emergence as an analogy. If you already know that what is observed in aggregate is not expressed by its components, then why is it hard for you to understand/see that a formalism (components) does not map to the nontrivial patterns it approximates? Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics No. You are framing the problem entirely in terms of the formalism's limitations. Approximating patterns is not restricted by some imaginary direct mapping between formalism and system. The ability to approximate patterns is not restricted to the formalism. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics The ability to approximate patterns cannot come by virtue of explicit encoding. You have to operate in the "meta" of the formalism, hence self-reference. A formalism has to be able to talk about its own limitations to go beyond them. This is the essence of Godel/Turing. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics Yes, we agree no formalism can encode the whole system. The argument is that not only does the formal system not need to, but that if it did it would fail to approximate anything. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics This isn't correct. The axioms do not (cannot) map directly to the system they approximate when that system is nontrivial. You are suggesting a formalism must capture all details of its modeled system. No model does this. A model by definition leaves most details out. Sep 23, 2019 
There’s no such thing as simplification without loss of information. Simple models work with simple systems because the information delta is minimal. Not so with the complex. If you choose to use simple models on the complex you must account for what your model has left behind. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics Axioms are only required to be "right" with respect to the internal logic of the language to which they belong. That logical consistency does not (provably) extend outside the formalism. If it did, computing would be confined to basic arithmetic, which it is (demonstrably) not. Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics For a self-referencing system to approximate another nontrivial system it requires iteration (otherwise there is no self-referencing). Iteration, fully leveraged as trial-and-error, enables a formalism to express any pattern by correcting early faulty mappings (input/output). Sep 23, 2019 
@normonics There are guarantees on the capability of capturing, but not on something having been captured with a given model. The former is guaranteed by axiomatic restriction. The latter depends on the system's ability to leverage its self-reference via trial-and-error. Sep 23, 2019 
Godel and Turing place limits on axiomatic systems wrt proofs and consistency. They do NOT limit what can be modeled using these formalisms. The ability to represent ANY pattern is born out of these restrictions, because only through a constraint can you achieve self-reference. Sep 23, 2019

@normonics What are they? Memory? Teach anyone method of loci and they can enter a memory competition. Number of neurons? Elephants have more. Architecture? Again, plasticity. Aug 14, 2019 
@normonics Sure, but if these resource constraints dictate individual intelligence then you have to define what those resources are and how they vary within populations. Aug 14, 2019 
@normonics Also keep in mind that Turing used infinite resources in his model to show that DESPITE unlimited resources there are problems that cannot be solved. So even TM detaches resources from problems. Aug 14, 2019 
@normonics If someone can search through the possibility space via heuristic shortcuts then this brings us back to representational power and isomorphic patterns as the true constraint; one which is shared equally across people. Aug 14, 2019 
@normonics While complexity theory gets obsessed with worst case scenarios, the reality is humans use heuristics and approximations to solve complex problems. This tells us that worst-case scenario resource constraints are not realistic caps on performance. Aug 14, 2019 
@normonics I don’t agree with the resources argument. Yes, as an abstract model of computation TM demands infinite resources, but to what extent do we see this constraint play out in real-world problem solving? Aug 14, 2019 
@normonics To deny self-referencing encodings can emulate any complexity goes against both Godel and Turing ... so if you’re right, write your paper :) I’m not sure what you mean by your central controller argument. Aug 14, 2019 
@normonics But today’s hardware/software is largely rules-based and doesn’t have its inner circuitry surpassing the threshold of complexity required for arbitrary pattern emulation. Aug 14, 2019 
@normonics I believe people get hung-up on the resources argument because we like to frame all computation in terms of everyday computers. Aug 14, 2019 
@normonics The human brain/mind is able to embody arbitrary complexity because of its representational power, not because of its resources. Representational power is already built-in prior to any resources being applied. Aug 14, 2019 
@normonics ? Aug 13, 2019

@normonics We can indeed embody arbitrary complexity. That’s the point of universality. This is available to any system passing the “Godel-Turing” threshold (and memory as resource shows no practical upper bound). Aug 13, 2019

@normonics I don’t get the software angle. If the mind is an emergent property of the physical brain then there is no software. For other possibilities (resources, arch) why must this be available for performance? Performance would “increase” based on pre-existing pattern availability, .. Aug 13, 2019 
@normonics 5/ We can thus frame any aspect of cognitive ability under universality. For example, if someone answers more quickly they are merely drawing upon patterns more familiar than someone else's preexisting patterns. No one has a superior machine. Aug 13, 2019 
@normonics 4/ People assume patterns as being contained within themselves, but with universality patterns can be isomorphic to other patterns of any complexity. This is the bridge to analogy, which arguably underpins all thinking. Aug 13, 2019 
@normonics 3/ In other words, if everyone has a universal machine then it can't follow that someone's mental capability is "better" than another's. Aug 13, 2019 
@normonics 2/ If we accept this, and view the human brain/mind as equally universal, then we must also accept a detachment between the notion of intelligence and an individual's supposedly unique mental ability. Aug 13, 2019 
@normonics 1/ We know from both Godel and Turing that any substrate capable of computing with a self-referencing language can emulate any computation and thus any pattern, regardless how trivial its makeup. Aug 13, 2019 
The future belongs to builders not planners. Aug 12, 2019 
@LorenzoWVilla @trishankkarthik 3/ But anyone's ability to form connections between culturally-specific ideas (as baked into IQ tests) will be stronger/quicker for those from that culture/background. IQ questions reflect specific culturally-related learning / cognitive preparedness. Aug 12, 2019 
@LorenzoWVilla @trishankkarthik 2/ To say speed of execution is an inherent property of an individual's unique intelligence you would have to separate analogizing speed from one's cultural background. Aug 12, 2019 
@LorenzoWVilla @trishankkarthik 1/ Speed of execution will stem from one's ability to make analogies. Analogy is "the fabric of cognition." Universality provides everyone with the same fundamental ability to relate isomorphic patterns between concepts. Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin Great stuff. Keep me posted. Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin 2/ Douglas Hofstadter discusses in Strange Loop, "symbols trigger more symbols" and thus “perception” is just further symbolic activity. Important people understand this. Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin Possible Addition 1/ Might be worth briefly discussing Searle's Chinese room, since people find it hard to believe simple rules can capture perception/meaning. Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin 2/ As long as each description is correct, NONE of them is privileged. Thus as you argue, universality easily trumps any view based on oversimplified superficial ranking. Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin 1/ Yes, this is exactly right. You could continue to discuss how any pattern can stand for anything to which it is isomorphic. Thus, someone calling an operation “multiplication by 256” might be described by someone else as left-shift by 8 bits. https://t.co/b3EXhCggIz Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin 2/ IQ has major issues with what it calls “prediction” but it stems from the simplicity/naiveté of their chosen methods, which are not commensurate with predicting complex phenomena. Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin 1/ I don’t like this argument. Complexity comes to us by way of extra dimensions, and those extra dimensions provide additional information. There is just as much a “blessing” of dimensionality as a curse. https://t.co/VZcm6HKtQz Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin 4/ The limitations of a formal language arise from its ability to be self-referential (leads to paradox). But that self-referencing is precisely why such language can express anything. So undecidability cannot preclude all prediction. Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin 3/ Prediction is possible because the machine (comp or brain) can mirror the pattern it observes and thus form a model (approximation) of that pattern. Models are what make prediction possible. Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin 2/ Both Gödel and Turing showed that numbers are a universal medium for embedding patterns of any sort. A computer dealing with arbitrary patterns is how complex systems get predicted. Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin 1/ I don’t see undecidability as precluding all of prediction. Not predicting the halting problem isn’t the same as not predicting anything. Prediction is at the heart of science and is what makes it a valid endeavor. https://t.co/RGrrxXzIj4 Aug 12, 2019 
@trishankkarthik @moyix @SimonDeDeo @imleslahdin I don’t think it’s right to suggest we could do “better”, as though a TM is limited. Turing realized his machine has the level of flexibility to imitate any other machine. There is nothing more flexible than a universal machine. "Universality is as far as you can go." https://t.co/wlztXJHFbp Aug 12, 2019

@TweetinChar Utilizing an incomplete system in your studies doesn’t justify filling in its gaps with baseless inferences, or using what does work, incorrectly. If IQ researchers don’t like the shackles of mathematics or the rigor of true #science why do they bother attempting to use them? Aug 06, 2019 
@TweetinChar This is a meaningless statement. Saying science had no definition invites any random idea into the fold, allowing people to fly the flag of science with no tether to reality, let alone centuries of empirical methodology designed specifically to weed out baseless conclusions. Aug 06, 2019 
@TweetinChar Case rested. You have no argument. This isn’t about conceit or grandstanding. It’s about doing REAL science, understanding what measurement means, knowing how to interpret data and correlation, and not promoting BS for the sake of influencing policy. Aug 06, 2019 
@TweetinChar Let’s see if you can do it. Try to construct a rational argument with both substantiated premises and logical consistency, and defend IQ research. Don’t call upon feelings or refer to so-called “experts” ... the validity of science doesn’t rest on an individual’s reputation. Aug 06, 2019

@MoneyEvil @nntaleb @yhazony @clairlemon Fitting a model to data and discovering a model from data are 2 very different things.

@MoneyEvil @nntaleb @yhazony @clairlemon Forcing a statistically convenient model onto something overtly complex is not science. This is caused by "physics-envy" where those studying complex phenomena want to anchor their narrative on simplistic models that are easy to understand (and influence policy with). Jul 28, 2019 
@MoneyEvil @nntaleb @yhazony @clairlemon Reality is nonlinear, involving higher dimensions than anything simplistic statistical techniques can model correctly. If you want to model reality you need to use high-dim approaches that can adequately approximate complexity. Jul 28, 2019

@frobnosticus ... rather this natural ability needs to be encouraged. In my experience, "best practices" discourage the reliance on embracing trial-and-error, instead encouraging students and practitioners to rely on formalized and accepted approaches to creativity. Jul 27, 2019 
@frobnosticus We tend to overestimate the reach of knowledge, and disregard the possibilities of innate human reasoning. The messiness of trial-and-error is where the needed information resides for designing systems correctly. The understanding to reflect and adapt doesn't need to be taught... Jul 27, 2019 
@frobnosticus Yes agreed. The degrees are devoid of real-world practitioner skills. I am using "best practices" as in upfront design choices preached by the industry, locking practitioners into rigid dogma, instead of thinking for themselves and adapting in the face of what actually works. Jul 27, 2019 
@frobnosticus This would mean best practices can foresee almost the entire journey prior to taking action. The world is much too complex for that kind of naïveté to work. My original statement is precisely the best and most realistic advice for any beginner. Adaptation beats directives. Jul 27, 2019 
Don't follow "best practices" ... question them and use them only when they survive trial and error. Your guide is what settles after iteration, not some teleological system that "knows" what's best before trying. Jul 27, 2019

@TweetinChar @MirjamN @DTWillingham To decide what, after settling, is worth keeping? Yes, I can see the knowledge role there. Jul 25, 2019 
@TweetinChar @MirjamN @DTWillingham That’s just it. Creativity does not require a teleological view. Creativity IS random slicing and dicing. It’s what settles after massive variation leads to a solution. Suggesting creativity is something that requires meaning only reflects the human need to find causality. Jul 25, 2019 
@MirjamN @TweetinChar @DTWillingham But if we see creativity as something other than one’s ability to explore the possibility space then what is it? Magic? I don’t think creativity is as ephemeral or mysterious as many people think. Jul 25, 2019 
@MirjamN @TweetinChar @DTWillingham Rather, creativity leads to solutions. Jul 25, 2019 
@MirjamN @TweetinChar @DTWillingham The ability to generate something new that serves a purpose. Creativity, to me, is a solution. Nature constantly creates new solutions by leveraging variation to adapt to stressors in the environment. How is human creativity any different? Jul 25, 2019 
@TweetinChar @MirjamN @DTWillingham It resides in one’s capacity to explore. To remove oneself from their paradigm and find analogies between domains. It’s the ability to embrace and leverage randomness and variation to create better solutions. The most creativity we see is in nature; where’s the “expert” there? Jul 25, 2019 
@MirjamN @DTWillingham Perhaps different experiences as well. I’ve seen more static than dynamic experts, but I definitely prefer your definition of expert. Here’s to more of those types 🍷 Jul 25, 2019 
@DTWillingham You already posted evidence. What are you looking for, social studies that use “p values” to argue creative thinking is better than deep skills? Just ask Silicon Valley. We’re the ones running the economy. Jul 25, 2019 
@MirjamN @DTWillingham Sure I get called an “expert” but that term is meaningless. My job changes constantly, tech changes constantly, problems change constantly. The world needs adaptation not myopic depth. Deep thinking comes from iteration, not dedicating one self to “expertise.” Jul 25, 2019 
@MirjamN @DTWillingham around new ideas, new technologies, and shifting paradigms. “Expertise” is literally the antithesis of creativity and innovative ideation. You can’t build an edifice of locked-in, dogmatic, rules-based, institutionalized thinking and call it creative. Jul 25, 2019 
@MirjamN @DTWillingham “Experts” will defend your view because without the industry’s false narrative around the need for expertise they lose relevance in today’s economy. Nobody can be an “expert” in anticipating our highly complex, opaque, dynamic world. This requires the capacity to maneuver .... Jul 25, 2019 
@MirjamN @DTWillingham Those who are not “specialists” don’t suffer from the myopic stickiness of remaining inside one’s paradigm. This is why interdisciplinary fields are here, and why studies show teams beat specialists at solving problems. Jul 25, 2019 
@MirjamN @DTWillingham Experts in creativity? Creativity cannot be taught, it comes from exploring the space of possibilities. Nobody owns creativity, it’s as human as thinking, feeling and acting. Countless discoveries have been made from people outside the domain of interest. Jul 25, 2019 
@DTWillingham Yep. Specialists have been overrated for some time now. Innovation comes from making conceptual connections between disparate areas.

@matthewputman @normonics @SimonDeDeo Indeed. We can say AGI (which Go is not), if possible, would have the ability to adjust its anchoring rules. But only in the immediate vicinity of its tasks.

@matthewputman @normonics @SimonDeDeo The point is the "environment" presents constraints, and any agent must operate within those constraints. Creativity always has a "task" ... nobody starts blowing into a clarinet randomly. They use finger movements, apply pressures, and maneuver through the possibility space. Jul 23, 2019

I cannot try to enter a black hole, or run faster than light. I am constrained. Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo I didn’t day that. I said AI sits at the boundary of true complexity. As such, we cannot say today’s AI has no true intelligence to it. Our only operative definition of intelligence is something that emerges from complex neuronal interactions. Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo Agents with pain receptors learn rules from their environment. Agents with ML algos learn rules from their environment (a snapshot of which is captured as data). Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo But there is always information transfer from the environment that communicates rules. Where do the rules of “don’t eat colored mushrooms” or “don’t piss off the badger” come from? Rules are imposed by the environment. What diff does it make what constitutes environment? Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo And assuming the AI required what a human does to survive. Technicallly it just needs to discover how to generate electricity and not rust away. Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo Not the same. But if you dropped an infant in the Savanna, not only would it not survive it wouldn’t understand the instructions. Humans require years of training. AlphaGo became best player in history in 6 weeks. So are we asking if an AI could survive given years of training? Jul 23, 2019 
@normonics @sothisispietro @SimonDeDeo No, the architects of Go do. Now switch the agent to human. Does your mind define the win state of staying alive? No. That’s defined by the rules of the environment. What about a musician? Same thing. He plays and either produces something pleasing or not. Always a win state. Jul 23, 2019 
@normonics @sothisispietro @SimonDeDeo I understand. But there is no such thing as not choosing to impose a win state in reality. Every task a human can perform has a win state. That’s how it gets defined. Even saying AI cannot do what we do uses a win state. I don’t agree reality has no win state. Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo You are framing AI in terms of traditional software. AI is a fundamentally different computing paradigm. AI is not “programmed.” It uses heuristics and optimization to arrive at solutions in ways we do not know how. It is not about rules. Rules are the antithesis of AI. Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo The point is this: in AI you cannot say you are completely defining your space of possibilities with top down rules. This is not how Go works. Its actions emerge from trial and error. Its operations are opaque. There is no rule book. If you found it you’d win the Nobel prize. Jul 23, 2019 
@normonics @sothisispietro @SimonDeDeo Alright. Like all great problems littered with paradox and profoundness I think we’ve brought this one to the edge of sanity. Great conversation, but I need to work. Perhaps over beers/wine some day 👍 🍷 Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo That’s not an argument. Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo All nature exists within a space of possibilities. If “rules” are not defining the space of possibilities in natural systems then what is demarcating the space of what’s possible? Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo Are you saying true intelligence doesn’t emerge from rules. If so, prove it. Jul 23, 2019 
@normonics @SimonDeDeo But you yourself are defining a win state. What exactly is real world ecology and what would have to happen for you to say AI has it mastered? Nothing can be defined without constraints. Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo This is exaclty how people spoke about chess, then Go, then poker. See the “AI effect.” You think your game demands something a machine cannot do, until it does. Then you choose a new benchmark for “true” intelligence. Jul 23, 2019 
@sothisispietro @normonics @SimonDeDeo It sits at the boundary of “true” complexity yes. This is discussed in literature. Causal opacity is the hallmark of complex systems. Also, AI has the record for extending the prediction horizon on chaotic systems. As complex as ecology? No. But truly complex? Yes. Jul 23, 2019 
Answer to Why are there so many fake data scientists and machine learning engineers? To say there are a large number of fake Data Scientists is to assume you know what a real version of this position looks like. #datascience #machinelearning https://t.co/OKMwU3utwN Jul 23, 2019 
@normonics @SimonDeDeo All agents have to play within the rules of the game, humans included. What we view as the “whole world” may in fact be severly limited. So now we’re just comparing constraints. Machines are constrained within the broader human definition of “world.” Jul 23, 2019 
@SimonDeDeo @normonics Or more precisely, is it possible to pursue any vocation in the absence of domain constraints? Jul 23, 2019 
@SimonDeDeo @normonics Fixed rules don’t limit the expressing of patterns. Hofstadter argues this nicely in strange loop. Domain constraints operate at a higher level, and can constrain possible patterns. But when is music truly free of domain constraints? Jul 23, 2019 
“Agreed, I just wonder how many #math teachers know how to use Python, or even code for that matter.” https://t.co/YZsrJy8iBr Jul 23, 2019 
@normonics @SimonDeDeo This is like saying anything can be art. If art can be anything then it ceases to have a definition. If you cannot demarcate a domain then the domain doesn’t exist. Jul 23, 2019 
@normonics @SimonDeDeo Also, we can just as easily argue that human minds are more bounded than AI. ML solves in high-dimensional space, people cannot visualize beyond 3D. If AI exhibits opacity than you cannot proclaim you know its bounds. Jul 23, 2019 
@normonics @SimonDeDeo The rules of ants interacting are well-known and specific too. But those rules don’t describe the emergent outputs produced by the colony. AI exhibits causal opacity (black box) because it is itself complex. Rules-based arguments cannot be used to discount AI. Jul 23, 2019 
@normonics @SimonDeDeo Probabilistic outputs do not have a clear set of next moves. People who argue against machine intelligence are framing their arguments inside a rules-based programming paradigm. This isn’t how ML works. ML builds soft approximations of complex realities producing “soft” outputs. Jul 23, 2019 
@SimonDeDeo Then the onus is on you to prove that human intelligence is not “pattern recognition and secretarial work.” Jul 23, 2019 
@SimonDeDeo Indeed. AlphaGo Zero used self-play to become the best Go player in the world. “Discovery” is not some mystical force humans are endowed with; progress occurs via trial and error. This doesn’t fit our BS narrative of human progress, so we proclaim machines can’t do what we do. Jul 23, 2019 
@SimonDeDeo Recent Nature paper showed Word2Vec used to discover new compounds in materials science, by mining latent knowledge in text. By all accounts these are genuine discoveries made by the machine, using analogies between disparate domains. https://t.co/Pr96aYW4a9 Jul 23, 2019 
@SimonDeDeo The “AI Effect” Onlookers will forever discount the behavior of an AI program by arguing that it is not “real” intelligence. Of course the fallacy in all this is we don’t have a settled definition of “intelligence” so discounting its possibility in a machine is erroneous. Jul 23, 2019

@ChemistCulinary @Mangan150 @plantloverbarb So to answer your question, always see if research aligns with how complex systems actually work. #lindy is a good example. If something has been eaten/practiced/read for a long time before you were born it’s proven itself to be commensurate with our biology. Jul 23, 2019 
@ChemistCulinary @Mangan150 @plantloverbarb It’s because nutritional “science” is too complex to treat like harder sciences.

@bindureddy This isn’t unique to AI. 1. All science suffers from some degree of reproducibility crisis; 2.

@sobu_18 @trishankkarthik @nntaleb "Theoretical physics suffers a strong temptation to depart from science and become math-based science fiction." - Richard Muller, Prof Physics, UC Berkeley Jun 28, 2019 
@sobu_18 @trishankkarthik @nntaleb Theoretical physicists have publicly moved away from Popperism in favor of resting their theories on pure math. Again, no opinion there. If you want to put quotes around someone's "science" then you'll need better arguments than "physics is solid." Jun 28, 2019 
@sobu_18 @trishankkarthik @nntaleb Any paradigm shift left for science must rest on bridging that chasm. Creating a mathematical model the describes complex systems (fluids, society, etc.) is not making explicit connections between rules and outputs. Jun 28, 2019 
@sobu_18 @trishankkarthik @nntaleb The "solidity" of physics is only apparent in its reliance on simplistic formalism and rules. There is no "expertise" that has ever bridged the chasm between simple rules and complexity. That chasm is literally THE most pressing topic in all of science. Jun 28, 2019 
@sobu_18 @trishankkarthik @nntaleb It's not about expertise, it's about fact. The fact is science has never been able to make explicit connections between formalistic rules and emergent phenomena. There is no opinion in that statement. Jun 28, 2019

@MirjamN As in, given access to free resources anyone can educate themselves. Education should be a choice, not a price tag.

@MirjamN My take; equal opportunity will only be possible when we stop requiring expensive degrees to contribute to the economy.

@patrickc 4/4 So the derivation you speak about is just running this history in reverse, showing that magnetism is just a relativistic aspect of electricity. Purcell did it in the 60s, and Hans de Vries updated this in 2008, with a much simpler derivation. https://t.co/iiifAPHDs7 Jun 13, 2019

@richardveryard @j2bryson @AlexBenay @alan_winfield 2.2 Code inspection makes absolutely no sense in nondeterministic systems.

@gideonro 3/3 Feedback from my actions are fed back into the machine for further knowledge creation. So the amount of knowledge creation humans are involved in going forward will depend on how “in-the-loop” we can keep people with their AI tooling. Jun 11, 2019 
@gideonro 2/3 ... is the knowledge fully retained by the machine, or do humans still partake in this knowledge creation? If I use AI to help my business make decisions I’m sitting those decisions on top of the machine’s generated knowledge. Jun 11, 2019 
@gideonro 1/3 I think we have to accept that machines are sitting at the boundary of “conceptualizing” information into knowledge. So yes, knowledge creation, albeit rudimentary, is occurring. After all, complex machines adapt. I think the question now becomes ... Jun 11, 2019 
@gideonro 2/2 But the utility of any knowledge I infer from that experience depends on my ability to survive using that knowledge. So knowledge is useful insomuch as it enables me to adapt to change. Jun 11, 2019 
@gideonro 1/2 Comparisons between the Information Economy and Knowledge Economy say "information" is collected data, while "knowledge" is what we infer from those data. Data are "information" transferred from the environment, so always indirectly attached to experience. Jun 11, 2019 
@j2bryson @AlexBenay Knowing how each step of the pipeline was constructed is important, but this isn’t the same as knowing how AI arrived at its biased decisions. So we can inspect the steps, but how AI uses those steps to produce output is opaque. Inspectors must infer what someone’s steps mean. Jun 11, 2019 
@j2bryson @AlexBenay But I agree, we are merely dancing around semantics rather than the heart of the issue, which I see as the need for actual steps to take, and I see you making solid contributions (best I’ve seen actually). But we need to also accept that complex systems are fundamentally opague. Jun 11, 2019 
@j2bryson @AlexBenay 1/2 The single most outstanding problem in all of science is the disconnect between simplistic rules-based phenomena and emergent complex systems. That isn’t an opinion. An entire new field of science has been built up around this problem for a reason. Jun 11, 2019

@j2bryson @AlexBenay No. The scaffolding is programmed, not the AI, AI in today's major products (yes this is only ML) is not rules-based. Anything programmed is "let loose" on the data and outputs are arrived at via optimization and convergence. This is why ethics conversations in AI are incomplete. https://t.co/mxu3v9D9Qs Jun 11, 2019 
@j2bryson @AlexBenay Do we have confidence in any current inspector's ability to know what to look for? As long as we talk as though AI is "programmed" we will never have a tangible framework for ensuring ethical standards in AI. AI isn't engineered, it's discovered. Where is this framework?
